    <name>1941: Counter Attack</name>
    <desc>The goal is to shoot down enemy airplanes and collect weapon power-ups (POW). One is only able to perform three loops per level and a bonus is awarded at the end of the level for unused loops. Player 1 uses a P-38 Lightning and Player 2 uses a Mosquito Mk IV. The game shifts from the original Pacific Front setting with that of the Western Front.

The game consists of six levels.

It was the first shoot 'em up to add +1 to the score when a continue is used.[1]</desc>

    <name>1942</name>
    <desc>"1942" is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up set in the Pacific theatre during World War II, in which the goal is to reach Tokyo and destroy the entire Japanese air fleet.  
 
The player pilots a plane dubbed the "Super Ace" (its appearance is that of a Lockheed P-38 Lightning) and has to shoot down waves of enemy planes while avoiding incoming enemy fire. The 'Super Ace' can perform a limited number of rolls or 'loop-the-loops' to evade enemy planes and shots.  
 
During the game, waves of red enemy planes periodically appear. If the player manages to destroy a red wave, a power-up, in the form of a 'POW' symbol, will be dropped and can be picked up. The power-up will award either increased fire-power (doubling the player's guns from two to four), a smart bomb that destroys all on-screen enemy planes the instant it's collected, two wingmen planes that flank the Super Ace and increase fire power, or simply extra points. 
 
At the end of each stage the 'Super Ace' lands on an aircraft carrier and bonus points are awarded based on player performance. "1942" differs from other games in that its levels are numbered in reverse order, so the game begins at stage 32 and ends at stage 1.</desc>

    <name>1943: The Battle of Midway</name>
    <desc>The game is set in the Pacific theater of World War II, off the coast of the Midway Atoll. The goal is to attack the Japanese Air Fleet that bombed the players' American Aircraft Carrier, pursue all Japanese Air and Sea forces, fly through the 16 levels of play, make their way to the Japanese battleship Yamato and destroy her. 11 Levels consist of an Air-to-Sea battle (with a huge battleship or an aircraft carrier as an End-Level Boss), while 5 levels consist of an all-aerial battle against a squadron of Japanese Bombers and a Mother Bomber that needs to be destroyed.
As in 1942, players pilot a P-38. Two buttons are used: one for regular attacks (with several weapons) and one for special actions that executes either a loop like in 1942 or one of three special attacks that damage the plane. Unlike 1942, the player only has one life, with one refillable energy meter. Destroying a complete formation of red enemy planes will result in a power-up, such as a health boost or a temporary special weapons which replaces the default twin gun.</desc>

The game operates and plays like most standard shooters. The objective of every level is to shoot enemy planes, tanks, trains, turrets, battleships, and defeat the boss after each level. Unlike its predecessor, 19XX: The War Against Destiny, the game plays more like the early games in the series.</desc>

    <name>720 Degrees</name>
    <desc>A one or two-player arcade game with players taking on the role of a skateboarder, and must perform various tricks and maneuvers to earn the points and tickets needed to compete for medals in the game's numerous skate parks.  
 
The bulk of the action takes place in a 'Skate City', a small urban area made up of ramps, jumps and hazards. Players can skate anywhere they wish as they perform the tricks and jumps needed to reach the score thresholds that will earn them entry tickets to Skate City's skate parks to compete for medals and cash prizes.  
 
Each score threshold must be reached and a park entered within a tight time limit. Failure to do so sees the skater persued by a swarm of bees and the words SKATE OR DIE appear. Should the bees touch the skater before he enters a park, the game ends. Skate City's roads and pavements are populated with moving traffic and pedestrians and any collision with them will result in the skater being knocked from his board, costing the player precious seconds.  
 
The parks themselves each feature one of four different disciplines: Slalom, Jump, Downhill and Ramp. Each park has a timer and players can earn either a bronze, silver or gold medal - together with a cash prize - depending on how quickly the park is completed. If the park target score or finish line is not reached before the timer expires, no medal or money is awarded.  
 
Money won can be used to buy equipment upgrades from the stalls that litter Skate City. Players can buy upgraded boards, helmets, pads and shoes. Boards give faster speed; helmets allow for more risky maneuvers; pads give a faster recovery from falls and shoes provide more height on jumps, as well as giving a quicker standing start.  
 
At the start of each new game, players can select from one of two play modes. 'Training Level' is available for beginners and gives players numerous playing hints and tips. 'Experienced Level' is more challenging as well as offering fewer hints. It does, however, include the 'add-a-coin' feature, which allows for awards and items already won to be carried over to a new game.  
 
The main objective is to compete in as many skate parks as possible. There are numerous city hazards to be avoided, such as BMX riders, cars, Frisbee throwers and other skaters. To guide the player around Skate City are map tiles. Riding over one of these will temporaily pause the action and display the layout of the city, including the locations of the skate parks and equipment stalls.

    <desc>After Burner is another Sega game rendered with their then-ubiquitous 3-D sprite-scaling technology; this time putting the player into the seat of a powerful F14 Tomcat jet fighter.  
 
Players must fight their way through 21 colourful, fast-moving stages, shooting down waves of enemy fighters while avoiding the enemy's incoming missiles. The F14 is equipped with a machine gun and a limited number of homing missiles. The gun has infinite ammunition and targeting is achieved by maneuvering the Tomcat so that the targeting cursor situated just in front of the jet is placed over an enemy fighter.  
 
After Burner's straightforward shoot-em-up gameplay is simple and repetitive, but the game's incredible visuals ensured its success.</desc>

Shooting oncoming enemy aircrafts and bombing the enemies below, he tries to make his way through the different stages to reach the enemy base. When he finishes the first stage, he is transported to his next mission by ab aircraft carrier. He hops into his jet fighters, tanks, ships, helicopters, and aircraft carriers. The player must also be aware of unseen enemies and surprise attacks. 
 
Different kinds of power ups can be obtained throughout the game. These include: 
'3' 3-Way: Bullets fire forward, right, and left. 
'L' Laser: Player can shoot double lasers. 
'T' Triple: Missiles are fired that spread out three ways in front. 
'V' Vulcan: Rapid bullets are fired in the directions controlled. 
'B' Bomb: Air to ground missles which can be upgraded twice. 
'O' Orbital: A small drone using the same weaponry as the helicopter which can be otained by clearing a special formation of little red fighters. 
 
There is an additional super weapon that destroys all the enemies on the screen at once. However, use of this weapon is limited. 
 
Ajax contains 2 different types of stages: 2-D and 3-D. In the 2-D stage, the player controls a helicopter. In the 3-D stage, the player commands a jet fighter. 
 
Ajax features some impressive graphics filled with rotation and scaling effects (some may get a little dizzy, though!), a solid soundtrack and excellent game control. Highly recommended for any shoot'em up enthusiast!</desc>

    <desc>Alien Syndrome is a overhead-view run and gun game for one or two players in which a number of Mankind's space ships and bases have been overrun by an alien race, who have taken the human inhabitants hostage. 
 
Players control two soldiers named Ricky and Mary and must fight their way through large eight-way scrolling levels to rescue their captured comrades. Once a set number of hostages have been rescued, an exit opens and players can pass through it to fight the end-of-level guardian. Once the guardian is defeated, play moves onto the next stage. 
 
A time-bomb is automatically set at the start of each stage, which must then be completed before the bomb's timer runs down. Failure to finish the level in time results in the death of the player characters. Weapon upgrades and maps of the current level are available at certain points and are accessed via hatchways in the wall. 
 
Alien Syndrome consists of 6 full stages plus a 7th final mini-stage, consisting solely of a fight to the death against the game's final, massive guardian.</desc>

    <name>Aliens</name>
    <desc>Aliens is a scrolling run 'n' gun game for one or two players based on the classic 1986 science-fiction movie of the same name. Players take on the role of either Ellen Ripley (in the single-player game) or Corporal Hicks (in the two-player game) and must shoot their way through the alien-infested levels of the LV426 base to make their escape together with 'Newt', the little girl who survived the alien invasion of her settlement. 
 
Players begin the game armed only with a pulse rifle but will have opportunities to upgrade to other weapons, including flamethrowers and grenade launchers. Bombs can also be found that cause greater damage to the enemies. Each player life starts with eight health points which deplete upon contact with either an alien or an enemy projectile and once all health points are lost, the player loses a life. Each stage ends with a Boss encounter, with the game's final boss being the Alien Queen herself.  
 
As well as the standard side-scrolling stages, intermittent into-the-screen stages also feature that have the players riding atop the Marines' APC vehicle, shooting the hordes of aliens that swarm towards it. 
 
As well as the standard Aliens and Face-huggers from the original film (that now come in a variety of different colours), there are many enemies that were created only for the arcade game and have never appeared elsewhere in the Alien franchise. These include flying aliens and mutated humans, as well as all end-of-stage bosses prior to the Alien queen.</desc>

Before they can be killed, a pair of the Predators appear and destroy the Aliens. The Predators offer an alliance with the two humans in order to stop the Alien infestation.

The players take control of up to three of four characters: Dutch, Linn, a Predator hunter, and a Predator warrior, and battle the Aliens through several environments. In the process, the characters discover that the Alien presence on Earth is the result of an experiment headed by a renegade General Bush of the U.S. Colonial Marines in conjunction with the Weyland-Yutani corporation. They destroy the Alien hive by crashing a military ship into San Drad, causing a huge explosion. The Predator warrior then gives his wrist blades to Dutch and Linn in recognition of their skills as warriors, before the Predators depart back into space.</desc>

    <name>Amidar</name>
    <desc>Amidar is an abstract arcade game in which players must 'colour in' all of the rectangles on the screen. Each level has a number of patrolling enemies called 'Amidars' that must be avoided but players are aided in their task with the inclusion of a JUMP button which, when used, causes all the on-screen enemies to jump, giving the player time to escape. There are only three 'jumps' given per level, however. 
 
On odd-numbered levels, the player's character is a gorilla who eats coconuts; on even-numbered levels, it's a paint roller. The game's enemy Amidars are savages and pigs respectively. Whenever a rectangular portion of the board is cleared (either by collecting all surrounding coconuts, or painting all surrounding edges), the rectangle is coloured in and on the even levels, bonus points are awarded, while on the odd-numbered levels, points are awarded for each coconut eaten.  
 
If players manage to fill in all four corner rectangles of a board, they are briefly able to kill the enemies by touching them (similar to the 'Power-pill' from Namco's Pac-Man series). Enemies killed in this way fall to the bottom of the screen and recover after a few seconds. 
 
On the even-numbered paint roller levels, the roller cannot move too far from grid rectangles that have already been filled without running out of paint and having to return to completed parts of the map to refresh its supply. When this happens, any painted lines that are not part of a filled rectangle will vanish and must be painted again. This means that the player must build their completed squares around the starting point of the level and spread outwards, rather than completing squares on any part of the board as they can on the odd-numbered Gorilla levels. This makes filling in the corner rectangles to become invincible much more difficult. 
 
In between levels players are given the possibility of earning 5,000 bonus points. Here, an Amidar moves across the top of the screen, by pushing the jump button the Amidar traces a random path down towards the bottom of the screen. If the Amidar reaches a bunch of bananas, a bonus is awarded.</desc>

    <name>Arkanoid - Revenge Of Doh</name>
    <desc>Arkanoid - Revenge of DOH © 1987 Taito Corp. 
 
The mysterious enemy known as 'DOH' has returned to seek vengeance on the 'Vaus' space vessel. The player must once again take control of the Vaus and overcome many challenges in order to destroy DOH once and for all.  
 
An update of the popular 1986 original, Revenge of DOH sees the player battle through 34 rounds, taken from a grand total of 64. Revenge of DOH differs from its predecessor with the introduction of "Warp Gates". Upon completion of a round or when the Break ('B') pill is caught, two gates appear at the bottom left and bottom right of the play area respectively, the Vaus is then taken through one of the gates - the choice will affect which version of the next round is provided. 
 
The game also features two new features for bricks. Notched silver bricks, like normal silver bricks, take several hits to destroy. However, after a short period of time after destruction, they regenerate at full strength. Fortunately, clearing a level does not require that any notched bricks to be destroyed. Also, some bricks move from side to side as long as their left and/or right sides are not obstructed by other bricks. 
 
The game features a mini-boss in the form of a giant brain, which will help you practice for DOH. You must aim for the brain's mouth to defeat it.</desc>

    <desc>After a sudden alien assault, the Arkanoid spaceship has been destroyed and the only survivor, the small 'Vaus' space vessel, has been mysteriously trapped in another dimension by an unknown enemy. The player is charged with helping the 'Vaus' overcome the security systems, as well as the many enemies that guard them, before finally finding and destroying 'DOH', the alien responsible for the attack. 
 
Arkanoid is an update of the early ball and paddle video games - and specifically of Atari's 1978 classic, "Super Breakout" - in which the player takes control of a paddle at the bottom of the screen and must use it to deflect a ball into rows of bricks at the top of the screen, thus destroying them and, eventually, clearing the screen to progress to the next level.  
 
As well as impressive and colourful graphics, Arkanoid introduced a number of new elements to the classic bat 'n' ball gameplay. Certain bricks, when destroyed, would release a power-up - in the form of a falling capsule. the player had to catch the capsule to retrieve the power-up. Among the many enhancements the power-ups provided were an increased 'bat' size, multiple balls, 'sticky' ball (which would stick to the bat and could be released when the player chose) and even a laser, which allowed the player to shoot the bricks.</desc>

    <desc>In the year 2281, the war spanning half a century over territory between the United World Forces and the Raian Kingdom had at last come to an end.

But this peace was not to last. A year after a truce was signed between the two forces, former Raian army captain Azrael, who has converted himself into a cyborg in an attempt to become "the perfect warrior", has marshalled several thousand other cyborgs and declared war against the Raian Kingdom. Robbing mobile weapons from the army, this group of rogues has invaded the Raian capital of Merkid and has begun to abduct the civilians.

The United World Government, receiving an emergency message from the planet Raia, has but one choice: to organize and dispatch an army formed around its elite corps, a squadron of warriors called "Bloody Armor", to eradicate the enemy forces and rescue the civilians.

And so, in October 2282, the United World Forces begin to launch its attack upon the planet Raia.

The most intense battle in human history is about to begin...</desc>

    <name>Asterix</name>
    <desc>Asterix is a horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up for one or two players and is based on the French comic-book series, 'Asterix &amp; Obelix'. Players fight as either Asterix the Gaul or his best friend, Obelix, as they take on the might of the oppressive Roman Empire.  
 
Asterix and Obelix each have standard jump/attack controls, as well as a dash attack activated by tapping the joystick forward twice then pressing the attack button. Each character also posesses a powerful spinning arm attack, this is activated by holding the attack button for a short while until the character's face turns red, after which players must release the button. If the button is held down for too long, the character gets out of breath and takes a few seconds to recover. 
 
The heroes' main foes are Roman legionaries and fat - ocassionally horseback riding - centurions. After an enemy has been beaten enough to fall to the ground, he can be picked up and attacked again, the nature of the attack is dependant on which character picks them up; Asterix will spin the stunned enemy above his head, whereas Obelix smashes him repeatedly into the ground. These stunned enemies also act as tempoarary weapons, as they will cause damage to any other enemies they come into contact with.

    <name>Asteroids</name>
    <desc>Asteroids © 1979 Atari, Incorporated.

Asteroids is a legendary, genre defining game - in an era replete with genre-defining classics - in which a single player takes control of a spaceship trapped in the middle of an asteroid belt. A number of large, slow-moving asteroids drift randomly around the play area and must be shot by the player. When shot, the asteroids will break into a number of smaller pieces which must also be shot until eventually, all of the asteroids and fragments will be destroyed and the next wave begins. 

Asteroids introduced real-world physics to video games for the first time, with speed and inertia all adding to the player's problems. As well as the inertia of the player's ship - forcing the player to allow for the ship slowing down and speeding up whenever the Thrust button was utilized - shot asteroids would often send fragments flying in seemingly random directions, and at varying and unpredictable speeds. 

As well as the ever-present asteroids, flying saucers also make a regular appearance. These move horizontally and diagonally around the screen, firing at the player's ship, and must be quickly destroyed. They are destroyed when hit by the player's shot, when hit by a saucer's shot or when they collide with an asteroid. 

CAST OF CHARACTERS - 

Spaceship - This is you, the player. You can rotate 360 degrees, fire bullets, thrust forward in any direction, and hyperspace to safety if you feel you are in danger. 

Large Asteroid - These are the large rocks that fill the screen at the beginning of each stage. Hitting one with a bullet will break it apart into two Medium Asteroids. 

Medium Asteroid - Slightly smaller than Large Asteroids, but faster moving. Shooting one of these will result in two Small Asteroids. 

Small Asteroid - These are the smallest and fastest rocks on the screen. If a bullet hits one of these, it will vaporize. 

Large Saucer - Large flying saucers appear on the screen from time to time, randomly firing shots around the screen. They pose a minor threat. 

Small Saucer - The smaller flying saucers are deadlier than the large variety. They are much more precise with their shots, and are more likely to kill you. Eliminate them quickly or get out of their range.</desc>

    <desc>Battlezone is a classic one-player first person 3-D wire frame shoot-em-up in which the player controls a tank patrolling a dangerous war zone. Set in a valley surrounded by mountains, the aim is to destroy as many enemy tanks as possible, while avoiding return fire and destroying or avoiding the homing missiles that occasionally appear. 
 
Enemy tanks come in two varieties; standard slow-moving tanks and fast-moving 'Super Tanks'. A single hit taken from either an enemy tank or homing missile will result in the loss of a player tank. A flying saucer also occasionally appears but does not attack the player and can be either ignored or destroyed for bonus points. 
 
A radar screen at the top of the play area shows the current position of any enemy tanks or missiles within range, and the war zone is littered with indestructible pyramids and boxes that can provide temporary cover. Only a single shot is allowed on screen at any one time so accuracy of shots is vital to survival.</desc>

The Toads each vary in fighting style: Rash is nimble, Pimple is burly and strong, and Zitz is a balance of the two. Each Toad also has its own signature exaggerated power and attack, in which their limbs turn into objects such as axes and drills. 
 
In a visually unique twist, the Toads can knock the game's enemies 'off-screen' so that they appear to fly towards the players, breaking the fourth wall. Enemies include aliens, mutant rodents and snowmen. 
 
The game's stages, in addition to having their own unique visual theme, often differ in gameplay style. Some levels are Double Dragon-style 2.5D brawlers, while others are strictly two-dimensional, platform-like stages. In one level, the Toads wear jet-packs and descend a tunnel and in the final level, the Toads shoot enemies from a vehicle.</desc>

    <name>Biomechanical Toy</name>
    <desc>Biomechanical Toy is an eightway-scrolling platform shoot-em-up set in a world of magically-animated toys, in which the magical pendulum that animates the toys has been stolen by the evil 'Scrubby', a criminal once imprisoned for trying to steal the pendulum who has managed to escape and take his revenge. The player takes on the role of Inguz and is tasked with freeing the few remaining good toys that are trapped throughout the stages, while destroying or avoiding the many evil toys that now patrol the kingdom.  
 
Inguz carries a basic, single-firing pistol, although additional ammo clips can be found throughout the game that upgrade the gun with either extra shot power, automatic firing or exploding bullets. When the gun's current ammo clip is empty, Inguz will take a moment to reload, leaving him vulnerable to attack. Freed toys will give help to Inguz by providing additional firepower for a short time. 
 
Inguz begins each stage and each new life with a full health meter of eighty units, but food can be found that will replenish the meter. The player can lose a life either by running out of health, falling off the bottom of the screen (or into a hazard, such as a lava pit), or by running out of time. Clearing each stage awards bonus points based on both remaining time and health units. 
 
Checkpoints - indicated by red flags - are located at certain points throughout the stages. In the event of losing a life, play restarts from the last checkpoint reached. Objects with Inguz's face on them (such as wooden chests and balloons) release bonus items when shot.  
 
An abstract, oriental-looking face occasionally forms part of a level's platform which, when shot, releases balloons which can in turn be shot for bonus items. A giant flying hat also occasionally appears and will drop bonus items when shot. Smart Bombs can also be found at certain points that, when run into by Inguz, will damage or destroy all enemy toys on screen.</desc>

To aid him in his mission, Joe is equipped with a bionic arm; a telescopic grappling hook that is used to traverse the many platforms and ledges that make up the game's levels. The arm can also be used to temporarily stun enemies or knock them from platforms, as well as to retrieve the bonus items, wooden crates and weapons that are occasionally dropped into the war zone by parachute.  
 
As well as the bionic arm, Joe is armed with a shotgun used to kill enemies and destroy obstructions. The shotgun can only be fired left and right, however, and cannot be used at the same time as the bionic arm. More powerful guns can be picked up throughout the game. </desc>

    <desc>Black Dragon/Tiger is a scrolling platform shoot-em-up set in a fantasy world and is the spiritual successor to the Capcom classic, "Makaimura" ("Ghosts'n' Goblins" outside Japan). 
 
The player takes on the role of a barbarian hero who must jump and fight his way through a variety of colourful, enemy-packed levels, collecting treasure and weapon power-ups and rescuing the trapped 'wise old men' that litter the levels.  
 
Rescuing the wise men sees the player awarded 'Zeny coins'; these are the game's currency and allow the player to buy such items as weapon and armour upgrades, keys for treasure chests, anti-poisoning potions and health potions from the shops that appear on each level. Occasionally, a rescued wise man will also offer to sell the player weapon and armour power-ups.  
 
The barbarian hero is armed with a spiked mace on the end of a long chain, as well as unlimited throwing daggers. Both these and the armour worn by the barbarian (which offers limited protection from enemy attacks) can be upgraded by finding or buying the relevant power-ups. 
 
The sprawling, eight-way scrolling levels are packed with hidden bonuses to encourage and reward exploration. These bonuses are in the form of weapon and armour power-ups, as well as valuable treasure items. Many levels also include a hidden dungeon and each dungeon is filled with both bonus items and trapped wise men. 
 
Special items that reveal coins, upgraded armour, or simply bonus points can be found by attacking certain walls.</desc>

    <name>Blasteroids</name>
    <desc>Blasteroids is a 1 or 2-player update of Atari's seminal "Asteroids", where the object of the game is to clear all sectors of the asteroids and enemy ships. Once this task is completed, the player goes on to battle Mukor - the "boss" asteroid who rules all galaxies - and destroy him. 
 
The player's ship appears first in the center of four vortices, he or she must chose which vortex they wish to enter, which then transports them to a sector of their chosen star system. 
 
Unlike in "Asteroids", the player ship has a finite amount of fuel which must be replenished as often as possible. This is achieved by destroying specifically-colored asteroids which turn into collectible crystals. Not all sectors contain the crystal-bearing asteroids, however, and if the player runs out of fuel, a ship is lost. The game contains three different ship configurations and the player can switch between them at any time during a level. The three configurations are: Speeder (small and fast, but weak), Fighter (medium speed and strength) and Warrior (large and strong but very slow).

    <name>Bomb Jack</name>
    <desc>Bomb Jack is a fast-moving platform game in which the aim is to collect all of the bombs on each level before progressing to the next. A variety of constantly spawning mechanical enemies patrol the platforms and airspace so the longer a player takes to collect all of the bombs, the more difficult progress becomes.  
 
Extra point bonuses are awarded for collecting bombs with their fuses lit. Only one bomb at any time has a lit fuse, and collecting twenty or more of these lit bombs on any given level will earn the player points bonus (see TIPS AND TRICKS for details). Jack is pursued around each level by the spawning enemies and when he gets killed, he drops down to the nearest platform, always landing on his head.  
 
A 'Powerball' appears at semi-regular intervals and moves diagonally around the screen. If the player manages to grab this, all of the level's monsters are frozen for several seconds and can then be killed by having Jack fly into them (similar to the 'Powerpill' feature in "Pac-Man"). Collecting the Bonus 'B' symbols will increase the amount of points awarded for collecting bombs with their fuses lit. Picking up an 'Extra' symbol awards the player with an additional life, while catching the 'Special' symbol will give the player an extra credit.  
 
Each of Bomb Jack's levels feature one of five different background pictures, some of which represent famous historical landmarks. They are: the Sphinx in Egypt, the Acropolis in Greece, Castle Neuschwanstein in Bavaria, skyscrapers and a cityscape by night. While the backgrounds themselves are repeated as the game progresses, the platform layouts for each level are completely different. At least until level 18, after which the levels are repeated.  
 
The basic play mechanic of collecting objects to clear a level, as well as the powerball feature, is hugely reminiscent of Namco's seminal "Pac-Man".</desc>

    <name>Boogie Wings</name>
    <desc>A superbly playable, humourous and utterly unique shoot-em-up from the Date East stable. The player begins each life in control of a bi-plane with a huge metal hook attached to its rear. This hook can be used to pick up enemies, objects, bombs and vehicles which can then be thrown both at other enemies, and at any walls and doorways that may be barring the player's route. 
 
If the bi-plane takes two hits from enemy forces, it will explode and the player is forced to continue on foot. The on-foot sections play in a vaguely similar fashion to SNK's legendary "Metal Slug" series, but while on foot, the player has no protection from enemy hits and is very vulnerable to attack. As such, a replacement vehicle (which appear in the form of tanks, motorbikes, giant robots, elephants etc.) must be found quickly. 
 
Boogie Wings features highly detailed and completely destructible scenery, with a multitude of background animations making the game feel 'alive' and giving it much of its distinctive character. The game's settings are as original as its gameplay; with museums, fairgrounds, the inside of skyscrapers etc. all making an appearance. Boogie Wings soundtrack is also unique to the genre, with a mixture of well-known jazz and blues tunes accompanying the frenetic on-screen action.</desc>

The bubbles can also be used as temporary platforms, to help the dinosaurs reach previously inaccessible areas of a level.  
 
Any trapped enemies who are not killed quickly enough will turn red and escape their bubble prison. These angry enemies are much faster than before, making them harder to kill. Enemies also become angry if players are taking too long to complete a level. Defeated enemies are turned into bonus fruit items that can be collected for points. </desc>

While the game plays identically to its predecessor, several new changes and additions have been made to breathe new life into the classic gameplay. As well as new bonuses, weapons, enemies and characters, players can now create 'Multiple Bubbles'; if the player holds the button down for a few seconds before releasing, up to three bubbles are produced at once. </desc>

The chef must create a set number of burgers per level by collecting the separate ingredients needed to make each one (two pieces of bun, the burger itself and/or a garnish, such as lettuce or cheese).  
 
Each screen is made up of platforms joined by connecting ladders. At the bottom of the screen are a number of empty plates while the burger ingredients lay across the platforms directly above the plates. The chef must walk across the entire width of the ingredients to make them drop to the platform below. A burger is only completed once all of its ingredients have been dropped onto the corresponding plate at the bottom of the screen.  
 
The chef's efforts are hampered by the rogue ingredients that are constantly chasing him. They are called 'Mr. Hot Dog', 'Mr. Egg' and 'Mr. Pickle'. Any contact with them results in the loss of a life. The chef can temporarily freeze the enemies by throwing pepper at them. He only carries a limited amount of pepper but this can be replenished by collecting the bonus food items that randomly appear (ice cream cones, coffee, and fries). In addition to the pepper, any enemies located on a platform below the chef can be killed by dropping an available burger ingredient on top of them. .</desc>

    <desc>Cabal is a war themed shoot-em-up with one or simultaneous two-player gameplay in which two unnamed commandos must battle through five different stages - each containing four screens of play - to reach and defeat an evil dictator. 
 
The game is an into-the-screen shooter with the action viewed from an over-the-shoulder perspective. The commandos can move left and right to avoid incoming fire while the enemies themselves are targeted by moving an on-screen cross-hair over them and pressing fire. If the fire button is held down, the commando remains static, allowing for more accurate targeting of the cross-hair. While static, the commandos are vulnerable to incoming enemy fire. 
 
Initially, the commandos are armed with only a standard single-shot gun (albeit with unlimited-ammunition) and a limited number of grenades, but additional grenades and weapon power-ups can be earned as play progresses. 
 
As well as enemy troops, vehicles such as tanks, armoured cars and helicopters also appear and take numerous shots to destroy. When destroyed or killed, some on-screen targets release points bonuses and weapon power-ups that drop to the bottom of the screen and can be picked up by the commandos. Weapon power-ups include additional grenades, a rapid-fire machine and an automatic shotgun, which has a slightly lower firing rate but has a larger targeting cross-hair, allowing it to strike a wider area with each shot. 
 
Each of the game's screens is littered with buildings and barricades that can also be destroyed. This removes enemy cover as well as earning players bonus points.</desc>

    <name>Centipede</name>
    <desc>Centipede is a vertically oriented single screen shoot-em-up in which the aim is to use the 'Bug Blaster' to shoot the centipedes that snake down towards the bottom of the screen to amass as high a score as possible.  
 
The play-field is littered with randomly placed mushrooms and the rapidly descending Centipede changes direction when it runs into a mushroom. When a segment of the Centipede is shot, the segment is destroyed and a mushroom appears in its place, the Centipede then breaks into two smaller centipedes, each with its own head, and continues its descent.  
 
Players can move the Bug Blaster vertically as well as horizontally, although only for the lower fifth of the play-field. Mushrooms can also be shot for points and to clear blocked areas. Once a Centipede reaches the bottom of the screen, it starts snaking back up, but remains within the lower section of the play-field near the player's Bug Blaster. 
 
Additionally, any Centipede that reaches the very bottom of the screen without being shot releases its tail section which then becomes a new head. Other new heads also enter the screen from the bottom corners of the play-field as time progresses. 
 
Randomly moving Spiders also appear in the first wave. Spiders can destroy any mushrooms they move over, eliminating many mushroom targets for a player. If the Bug Blaster and a Spider collide, both are destroyed. the Spider either moves at a 45-degree angle or vertically up and down, never simply left or right like the centipede does. 
 
A bombardment of Fleas appears from the second wave onward. As a Flea descends, it leaves a trail of new mushrooms behind it. Fleas appear when a certain number of mushrooms remains at the bottom of the screen. This number increases as the game progresses, meaning Fleas appear more often later on in the game. The Bug Blaster must hit a Flea twice to destroy it; the first shot simply speeds up its descent. 
 
When a Centipede with fewer than eleven segments appears, a Scorpion enters from either side, moving at a relatively slow speed. As the player earns more points, the Scorpion's speed increases. As the Scorpion travels across the screen, it 'poisons' the mushrooms that it moves over and changes their colours. These mushrooms cause any Centipedes that would collide with them to head straight towards the bottom of the screen, rather than continue snaking left and right. The Bug Blaster can stop a poisoned Centipede by shooting its head. 
 
If a player earns at least 60,000 points, two things happen to increase the challenge: the Fleas descend at a faster speed and the Spiders restrict their movement to a smaller area at the bottom of the screen.</desc>

Joe's mission is to rescue captives and destroy the enemy bases and strongholds that appear at the end of each level, killing as many enemy soldiers as possible in the process.  
 
The end-of-level strongholds see waves of enemy soldiers ordered to attack by a cowardly officer, who immediately runs away. Shooting the fleeing officer earns the player bonus points. Along the way, players can attempt to free prisoners-of-war by shooting their enemy guard escorts as they are transported across the screen. 
 
Super Joe carries only two weapons: a limited-range machine gun with unlimited shots, and a limited supply of hand grenades. Extra grenades can be picked up as the player progresses through the levels.</desc>

    <desc>In 2631, a meteorite strikes the Galuga archipelago near New Zealand, carrying with it a dormant alien being. Two years later, a terrorist organization calling themselves Red Falcon takes over the island as part of their plot to invade the Earth. Bill Rizer and Lance Bean, of the Contra unit, are sent to the Oceania island to stop the evil threat. 
 
'Contra' is a hectic one or two player platform shoot-em-up featuring 10 stages. In addition to the standard side-view levels, there are also "3D maze" stages in which the player must proceed through a series of corridors inside an enemy base, destroying various sensors, in order to reach the core of the base. 
 
Each player's character is equipped with a semi-automatic machine gun with an unlimited amount of ammunition and can jump, move and fire in all eight cardinal directions. Players can also move and jump simultaneously while firing. Co-ordination of the character's movement is essential as a single hit from any enemy, bullet, or other hazard will instantly kill the player's character and also eliminate the current weapon from the player's inventory.

You will travel through eight levels throughout the city, in locations that range from subways to the docks. 

At the end of every stage is a fight with a boss character, many of whom happen to be knockoffs of famous horror movie antagonists like Freddy Kruger and Jason Voorhees. Scoring is handled by a system wherein you simply get a point for every enemy you kill. Occasionally examples of cartoon physics pop up, such as when your character gets squashed flat by a moving steamroller or a falling billboard.</desc>

    <name>Crystal Castles</name>
    <desc>Crystal Castles is an inventive variation on the maze-driven collect-the-dots gameplay first seen in Namco's legendary "Pac-Man". The player takes on the role of 'Bentley Bear', who must run around a number of "castles" - each presented in the form of an isometric forced 3D maze - picking up the gemstones that litter its walkways and platforms, before moving onto the next castle.  
 
Each level is populated by a variety of enemies, including sentient trees, gem eaters, a swarm of bees and Berthilda the Witch. Some enemy types move around the levels randomly, while others will actively chase Bentley. Gem Eaters will devour any gems they reach before the player.  
 
In addition to four-directional walking, Bentley can also jump to avoid pursuing enemies and obstacles. Many levels have platforms that can only be reached via an elevator and some screens also contain hidden secret passages and ramps, as well as 'warps' that move players forward several levels.  
 
Jumping over the trees will shrink and temporarily disable them, while wearing Berthilda's red hat grants the player temporary invincibility, allowing them to kill the witch should they manage to catch her. If Bentley Bear touches a Gem Eater while it's in the process of eating a gem, the Gem Eater dies and 500 points are awarded to the player. However, if the Gem Eater is not eating a gem when touched, Bentley Bear dies.  
 
Some levels contain a large pot of honey. A swarm of bees appears near the honey approximately every five seconds but collecting the honey pot earns the player 1,000 bonus points and causes the bees to appear less frequently. Other enemies, such as the balls, skeletons and ghosts must be avoided.  
 
If Bentley collects all of the gems on a castle, the player receives bonus points. A bonus is also awarded in the event of the player picking up the last gem on the level.  
 
Crystal Castles consists of ten different stages broken down into 37 castle mazes (with four castles making up each stage, apart from 10th, which has only one castle).</desc>

    <name>Defender</name>
    <desc>Defender is a legendary sideways-scrolling shoot-em-up - the very first of its genre - in which the aim is to pilot a laser-firing spaceship and protect humanoids stranded on the planet's surface from swarms of alien abductors. 
 
A long-range scanner at the top of the screen shows the positions of both the humanoids and the attacking aliens. The ideal strategy is to shoot down the alien ships before they reach the humanoids. If a humanoid is captured, the alien abductor can still be destroyed, but the player must then catch the falling humanoid and return it to the safety of the planet's surface before it falls to its death. 
 
If an alien is allowed to carry its victim to the very top of the screen, the humanoid will mutate, becoming a permanent part of the alien that captured it. This new and deadly mutation will then immediately join in the alien attack. 
 
The challenge becomes more intense as action progresses. Fighter ships and their mines will soon join the abductors. There are also mother ships that must be destroyed; these are particularly difficult as a direct hit smashes the mother ship into a swarming mass of mini-ships that must also be wiped out. Throughout the entire mission, the player must act quickly or face possible destruction by the cosmic baiter, a fast and dangerous enemy. 
 
Players have two escape options to use as a last resort. The first is the 'smart bomb', which destroys all on-screen enemies. The second option is 'hyperspace', which randomly teleports the player's ship to another part of the level. This is highly risky as it may place the player's ship in a position more dangerous than the one it left. 
 
If all humanoids are successfully abducted, the planet will explode in a blinding flash and the waves remaining until the next planet is reached take place in outer space, and consist solely of destroying enemy waves.</desc>

    <desc>For this sequel to the 1982 classic, "Dig Dug", Namco changed the game's perspective from a cutaway side-on viewpoint to an overhead one. The action now takes place on a series of small islands, the gameplay itself retains much from its predecessor, with Dig Dug still being chased by the 'Pookas' (round, goggle-wearing red enemies) and the 'Fygers' (green, fire-breathing dragons). 
 
As with the first game, Dig Dug is still armed with a pump that allows him to inflate and burst the enemies. For the sequel, however, he is also armed with a jackhammer. This can be used at the round ground-pegs scattered around each island to create and connect up fault lines in the ground. If both ends of a system of faults reaches the water, the ground surrounded by them will sink into the ocean killing all creatures on it, including Dig Dug himself if he is standing on the destroyed section of land.</desc>

    <desc>Dogyuun is an arcade Shoot 'em Up. 
 
The plot is somewhat vague, except that it involves two pilots destroying aliens after an alien mecha kills the reconnaissance ship leading them. 
 
One interesting feature of the game is the ability in Co-Op Multiplayer for player 1 to combine with player 2, producing a larger ship with better firepower. The game also features loads of homing lasers and large bosses.</desc>

    <desc>EVERYONE'S GOING APE OVER DONKEY KONG! 
 
"HELP! HELP!" cries the beautiful maiden as she is dragged up a labyrinth of structural beams by the ominous Donkey Kong. "SNORT. SNORT" Foreboding music warns of the eventual doom that awaits the poor girl, lest she somehow be miraculously rescued. "But, wait! Fear not, fair maiden. Little Mario, the carpenter, is in hot pursuit of you this very moment" 
 
Throwing fate to the wind, risking life and limb, or worse, little Mario tries desperately to climb the mighty fortress of steel, to save the lovely lady from the evil Mr. Kong. Little Mario must dodge all manner of obstacles - fireballs, plummeting beams and a barrage of exploding barrels fired at him by Donkey Kong. 
 
Amidst me beautiful girl's constant pleas for help, your challenge is to maneuver little Mario up the steel structure, while helping him to avoid the rapid-fire succession of hazards that come his way. 
 
As little Mario gallantly battles his way up the barriers, he is taunted and teased by Donkey Kong, who brazenly struts back and forth, beating his chest in joyful exuberance at the prospect of having the beautiful girl all to himself. It is your job to get little Mario to the top. For it is there, and only there, that he can send the mighty Donkey Kong to hit mortal doom. Leaving little Mario and the beautiful girl to live happily ever after. "SIGH. SIGH.” 
 
So, if you want the most exciting, most fun-filled, most talked about family video game on the market, don't monkey around with anything but the original Donkey Kong.</desc>

After Mario saved the Beautiful Girl from the lustful clutches of Donkey Kong, he led the brokenhearted ape into captivity, locking him behind steel bars, never again to strut his stuff before the fair maidens of the world. 
 
As the frustration of confinement enrages Donkey Kong, Mario complacently stands guard over the cell, holding the sought after key to freedom. 
 
But wait! Unbeknownst to Little Mario, Donkey Kong has produced an offspring - Donkey Kong Junior! A death-defying little monkey, shrewd and cunning, who resists all enemies to rescue Papa Donkey Kong. 
 
As Mario's brigade of snapping jaws, ape-eating birds and energy pods launch their offensive, Junior bombards them with a fusillade of Fruit Bombs that aim to annihilate his every foe.</desc>

    <desc>An excellent vertically scrolling shoot'em up. The player assumes the role of a pilot who is sent by their squadron to fight their former allies until one side destroys the other, all of which is a part of a mission to strengthen the military power that controls each side. The player flies their selected fighter over 5 areas of various terrain, encountering a number of land, sea and air enemies. The player's ship has two modes of fire: by tapping the fire button, shots are fired; holding it down produces a concentrated vertical beam, but also reduces the ship's speed. 
 
The player can choose one of 3 aircraft at the start of the game, or upon continuing: 
Type A: A red (or yellow/orange, for player two) fighter, which fires a narrow stream of shots 
Type B: A green (or purple, for player two) helicopter, which fires its main guns forward, but has side guns that rotate in the direction of movement 
Type C: A blue (or black, for player two) fighter, which fires a wide, three-way spread of shots</desc>

    <name>Double Dragon</name>
    <desc>Double Dragon is a side-scrolling beat-em-up for one or two players, featuring twin brothers and martial arts masters, "Billy &amp; Jimmy Lee". The brothers must defeat the savage street gang known as the 'Black Warriors' to rescue Billy's kidnapped girlfriend, Marian. Standing between the brothers and Marian are four huge, colorful and varied levels; each populated with a wide variety of thugs. 
 
Many of the game's enemies carry weapons (knives, baseball bats etc.) and should Billy or Jimmy manage to knock the weapons from the enemies' hands, the heroes can pick the weapons up and use them against the enemies. 
 
The Black Warriors is made up of six distinct enemy characters- plus Willy, the game's final boss - with each differing in both physical appearance and fighting style. The members of the Black Warriors consist of the following fighters:  
Williams - A street punk in a tank top. In addition to the standard punches and jump kicks, his signature technique is a body blow to the stomach. He also wields weapons such as baseball bats, knives and dynamite sticks. 
Rowper - A punk who wears matching-colored pants and shirtless vest. He wields all the same weapons as Williams, but can also lift and throw heavy objects such as oildrums, boxes and stones. 
Linda - Female punk who usually carries a whip. She's not very strong, as she falls down to ground with a couple of punches or a single kick (because of this, she is the only regular-sized enemy who cannot be placed on a headlock). 
Abobo - A tall, big-muscled bald guy. His attacks includes punches, a standing kick and a body toss. He can also lift and throw heavy objects like Rowper. Due to his large size, he cannot be put into a headlock. 
Boss 1 - The first boss, a head-swap of Abobo with a Mr. T-style mohawk and beard. Fights just like Abobo, only with an added double-handed slap. Unlike Abobo, he does not use weapons. A green version of him appears as the Mission 3 boss. 
Boss 2 - The second boss. A head swap of the player who uses almost all the same techniques.  
Willy - The game's final boss, armed, somewhat unfairly, with a machine-gun. 
 
Double Dragon was a huge success due to the many game-play innovations it brought to the genre (see TRIVIA for details), but it demonstrates its final moment of inspired genius at the very end of the game. Should both players still be alive after the final boss has been defeated, they will then have to fight each OTHER. The winner of this fight will be the one who wins Marian's affections.</desc>

    <name>Double Dragon II - The Revenge</name>
    <desc>Following his defeat at the end of the original Double Dragon, Willy, the leader of the Black Warriors, retaliates against Billy and Jimmy Lee by murdering their friend, Marian, leaving the brothers with the task to avenge her death. 
 
The sequel to Double Dragon is essentially an upgraded version of the original game, but with with a two-way attacking system similar to one previously used in Technos Japan's 1986 arcade game "Renegade". Many of the attacks and combos from the original "Double Dragon" are retained, as well as new techniques including the invincible Cyclone Kick. 
 
The stages and weapons are redesigned versions of items previously featured in the original game. There are a few new traps such as a bulldozer in the middle of Mission 3 and all of the transition sequences between stages are now done with the character entering the next level via a lift, making it impossible to carry one weapon to the next area. 
 
Most of the enemy characters return from the original Double Dragon, with some given facelifts, but the stage bosses are all new. The enemies are as followed: 
Williams - Has a wilder face and longer hair. He can now run towards the player and do cartwheels. He throws his knives in mid-air and sometimes carry a shovel which he throws towards the player. 
Rowper - Has a beard and eye-patch, but otherwise is more or less identical to his original self. He carries shovels and can sometime pick up large objects. 
Linda - She now has a mohawk and face paint. She can also jump off platforms and do the elbow strike against the player. In addition to the ball and chain, she also carries grenades and knives. 
Oharra - A strongman with a clean-shaved face. Replaces Abobo from the first game and has the same attacks. 
Bolo - A head-swap of Oharra with long hair and beard. Replaces the mohawked head-swap of Abobo from the first game. 
Jeff - Same as his original self, but now carries grenades. 
Burnov - The boss of Mission 1. An obese wrestler whose face is concealed with a mask. He grabs the player and throws similar punches in the face. After dying, he will stand up and yell, disappearing in front of the player and leaving only his clothes. In later encounters, he will revive himself at least once. 
Abore - The boss of Mission 2. A huge suspender-wearing strongman with Terminator-like sunglasses. His slaps and shoulder tackles do massive damage to the player. 
Chin Taimei - The boss of Mission 3. A Chinese martial artists armed with twin kali sticks. In addition to his energy-draining stick combo, he also has a jump kick and sweep kick. 
Willy - The boss of Mission 4. Looks like he does in the original game, but now dresses in red. He still uses the same machine gun from the first game. 
The clone - After defeating Willy, the player will have to fight their character's evil self. This clone has all the techniques the player has, but can also throw energy beams and possess the player's body to drain his energy.</desc>

    <name>Dragon Breed</name>
    <desc>Dragon Breed is a side-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player controls the game's hero, Kayus, who is riding on the back of a fully articulated dragon named 'Bahamoot'. The dragon is immune to enemy attacks, capable of blocking most projectiles and of damaging and eventually killing enemies on contact. Dragon rider Kayus is armed with a forward-firing crossbow but unlike his steed, is not invulnerable and will be killed by contact with either enemies or their projectiles.  
 
What separates Dragon Breed from other games in the genre is in how the Dragon can be utilised. Bahamoot's body is flexible and responds to Kayus' movement, enabling Kayus to use Bahamoot as both a mobile shield and a whip-like weapon. It's also possible to encircle the tail around a group of enemies to kill them. The tail of the yellow or blue dragon can be coiled around the dragon's rider to offer almost complete invulnerability for a limited time. 
 
Bahamoot can also spit fireballs. By holding the fire button down, the dragon will build up fire in its mouth; the longer the button is held down, the more powerful the fireball will be. There are four levels of fireball power and at its strongest, the fireball resembles a dragon's head. 
 
Power-ups appear in the form of orbs, acquired by shooting small green dragons that appear intermittently throughout stages. There are four different types of orbs, each of will change Bahamoot to a different colour and grant him a new attack power:  
Red orb enables the dragon to breathe a flame.  
Gold orb enables Bahamoot's body to fire crescents in all directions.  
Silver orb enables the dragon to produce up to four miniature dragons, which home in on enemies.  
Blue orb enables Bahamoot to fire bolts of electricity downwards from its underside.  
 
The player can enhance a specific power by picking up the same type of orb, this can be done up to three times.  
 
Dragon Breed also includes platforming elements. At certain points during a stage horizontal platforms appear, these often have power-ups on them and the dragon rider can dismount and run along the platforms while the dragon waits above.</desc>

    <desc>Enduro Racer is an off-road racing game in which players ride a dirt bike across five extremely hilly and twisting courses. Each course is littered with logs, rocks, trees and rival racers that must be either jumped over or avoided. 
 
Jumps can only be performed at specific locations on each track. These locations feature a dirt ramp that spreads across the width of the track. Players must have the bike in the 'wheelie' position when the ramp is struck, the bike will then be launched into the air. If the bike is not in a wheelie position when the ramps are struck, the bike will still clear the ramp, but will land front-wheel first and crash. 
 
Enduro Racer is perhaps best remembered for its 'Wheelie' feature, which required the player to physically lift the cabinet's handlebars to raise the front wheel of the game's on-screen counterpart.</desc>

    <desc>Exed Exes is an arcade vertical shooter developed by Capcom. It was licensed to Memetron and released outside of Japan in the arcades as Savage Bees Memetron (licensor to the game). It uses similar hardware to Capcom's 1942, but it is more of a spiritual successor to Capcom's earlier shooter Vulgus. It takes place in a science fiction alien hive where you must pilot your ship through many stages protected by insects, some as large as your craft, and some even larger. 
 
What made Exed Exes stand apart from other shooters, besides the high resolution graphics for its time, and the detailed use of parallax scrolling to indicate depth, was the fact that it was one of the earliest vertical shooters to allow for two player simultaneous play. Rather than waiting for one player to take his turn, two players could enjoy the game at the same time, and even work cooperatively to get further along in the game.</desc>

    <desc>Final Fight can be played by up to two players simultaneously, with each player controlling a different character. Before the game begins, the player chooses between the three main characters, Guy, Cody, and Haggar, each with his own fighting style and attributes. Guy is the weakest but has faster attacks, Haggar is the strongest but also the slowest, and Cody has all-round attributes.

Final Fight consists of six stages or "rounds", as well as two bonus rounds. Each round takes place in a different section of Metro City such as the Slums and the Subway, with most rounds featuring more than one level. At the end of each round the player will face a boss character unique to that round.</desc>

    <name>Galaga 88</name>
    <desc>Galaga 88 is an updated version of the old favorite, "Galaga", with more invaders and more player firepower. Galaga '88 gives players a chance to once again repel the invaders from the Galagan Kingdom. One or two players can try their hand at fighting the invaders. This time the Galagans have four more allies, each with unique weapons and defenses that a player must overcome.  
 
By destroying special enemies or obstacles the player can get 'items'. When a player has two items, they can warp to another dimension to confront more Galagan ships with new strategies. In the Challenging Stages (labelled in this game as 'That's Galactic Dancin'), the player shoots down as many invaders as possible as the Galagans dance to a waltz, tango, march or jazz tune.  
 
The player selects single or dual ship power. The objective is to destroy all the Galagan foes in each of the 29 sectors of the galaxy, with each sector more difficult than the last.  
 
Unique Features:  
More opponents. In addition to Boss, Goei and Zako, the original Galagan crew, Don, Nin, Ban, and Gan have been added. Each of the Galagans has a unique way of challenging the players.  
Different types of ships. Players can choose single or dual ships (if the game option is set for dual and single). When the player retrieves a dual ship from the Boss's tractor beam, it turns into a triple ship with ten times the power of a single ship.  
Challenging Stages. In the 'That's Galactic Dancin' stages, the Galagan invaders dance to a waltz, tango, Sousa march or jazz tune, while the player shoots down Galagans to earn bonus points.  
Warping to a new dimension. By destroying particular enemies or obstacles and capturing two of their items, the player can warp to the next dimension.  
Player challenge. Each dimension has different mix of Galagans with different strategies to be overcome.  
Win back captured ships. The player can win back ships captured in the Boss Galaga's tractor beam. When the player destroys the Boss, the ships are released. If the player retrieves them, the ships become dual ships if they were single and triple if they were dual.  
High Score Mode. Upon completing a game, a player can enter his initials if they are among the top eight scorers on the game.</desc>

    <name>Gauntlet</name>
    <desc>Gauntlet is a maze-based shoot-em-up for up to four players. Heavily influenced by classic fantasy conventions, players take on the role of either Thor the Warrior, Thyra the Valkyrie, Merlin the Wizard, or Questor the Elf and must play cooperatively as they explore and fight their way through the enemy-packed mazes. Competitive play is encouraged as players must fight for the limited amount of food, treasure, magic potions and power-up items that litter the dungeons.  
 
Each of Gauntlet's four characters have different strengths and weaknesses: Thyra has the strongest armour, Thor is best at hand-to-hand combat, Questor has the fastest speed and Merlin has the most powerful magic attacks. The object of the game is simply to survive as long as possible while exploring Gauntlet's mazes in search of treasure, food, magic potions and, ultimately, the exit that leads to the next dungeon.  
 
The potions - shown as blue bottles - that litter the levels offer either improved character abilities (such as 'speed' or 'extra shot power') or can be used as a 'smart bomb', destroying some or all of the on-screen monsters. Potions are also the only way to kill the game's 'Death' character that appears in many of the stages. Magic potions can be kept and used at the player's discretion by pressing 'Magic' button, although each potion can only be used once.  
 
The first seven mazes are always the same, but from level 8 onwards, players will find themselves on any one of over a hundred different mazes. If players survive for long enough, the mazes will be repeated in a different order. How long a player lasts depends upon the player's 'health' level. Health continually depletes as time progresses and further health is lost by contact with various monsters or their projectiles. Health can be replenished by consuming the food found in the mazes or by inserting more credits. The many treasure chests that litter the levels can be plundered for points, and collecting treasure increases a player's score multiplier when two or more players are playing the game.</desc>

    <name>Gauntlet 2</name>
    <desc>Gauntlet II is a direct sequel to the legendary maze-based fantasy themed shoot-em-up, released a year earlier. Atari chose not to tinker with the core game-play mechanic to any great degree, opting instead to enhance the already excellent multi-player action that had created such a stir upon the original game's release. 
 
As with its prequel, up to four players once again take on the role of either 'Thor the Warrior', 'Thyra the Valkyrie', 'Merlin the Wizard', or 'Questor the Elf' and must play cooperatively as they explore and fight their way through the enemy-packed mazes, collecting potions, food and treasure as they searched for the exit that would lead them to the next dungeon. 
 
Changes to the sequel included the ability for players to play whatever character they wanted, even if that character was already in play. Characters were now colour-coded and players would find themselves taking on the role of 'Blue Elf', 'Green Wizard', etc. New in-game speech was added to allow for the new player definitions. 
 
Other changes included the ability to 'bounce' shots off walls - known as 'Reflective Shots' - providing the correct potion was picked up. As well as new potions, Gauntlet II also featured several new monsters. The most notorious of the new additions was the Fire-breathing Dragon that guards the exit to some dungeons. This powerful creature takes multiple hits to kill and defeating it would see the players rewarded with a permanent potion and a bag of treasure. 
 
Another notable addition was the 'It' monster: any player who was tagged by the creature would suddenly find that all of that level's monsters would ONLY chase the tagged player, completely ignoring the presence of all other players. The only way to remove this curse was to tag another player, thus making them 'it'. 
 
New level elements were also added to further increase variety. These included dungeons with entirely invisible walls, magical walls (which changed into monsters or items when hit), stun tiles (which stunned any player that walked on them) and exits that flashed between functioning and non-functioning.</desc>

The player can only be hit twice before losing a life. If the player loses a life, they are returned to the start of the level, or the halfway point if they have managed to get that far. Furthermore, each life can only last a certain length of time. After defeating the final boss, the player must then replay the entire game on a higher difficulty level to reach the genuine final battle.</desc>

    <desc>Golden Axe is a sideways scrolling beat-em-up set in a traditional fantasy world, in which up to three warriors take up arms to rescue the kidnapped King and his Queen from the evil Death Adder. 
 
The game's three different playable characters are an Amazonian warrior named Tyris Flare, a Barbarian hero named Ax Battler, and a Viking dwarf named Gilius Thunderhead. Each character has a special attack move that is activated by pressing both JUMP and ATTACK at the same time. Also, double-tapping the joystick right or left will make the character charge and smash into opponents.</desc>

    <name>Golden Axe: The Revenge of Death Adder</name>
    <desc>Like it's legendary prequel, 1989's "Golden Axe"; 'Revenge' is sideways scrolling beat-em-up set in a traditional fantasy world, in which the evil 'Death Adder' has arisen to take over the lands. The game supports simultaneous four-player gameplay, with each player taking on one of the game's characters. The four available characters are 'Sternblade' (a barbarian warrior), 'Dora' (a female centaurian), 'Goah' (a giant with a dwarf sitting atop his shoulders) and 'Little Trix' (an agile, oriental-style warrior).</desc>

    <name>Gorf</name>
    <desc>The player's goal is to defeat the Gorfian Empire and safeguard the future of mankind. Gorf is a single screen shoot-em-up in the classic "Space Invaders" mould, the prime difference being that Gorf offers five distinct levels of shooting action. The levels are as follows:  
 
Mission 1 - Astro Battles: The first mission is more or less a straight clone of "Space Invaders", set against a sky-blue background. The player is protected by a glittering parabolic force field, which is gradually worn away by enemy projectiles. The force field also works in BOTH directions, and therefore must momentarily deactivate in order for the player's ship to fire out. To advance to the next mission, the player must destroy all the invaders.  
Mission 2 - Laser Attack: The other missions are all set in space. In this mission, the player is faced with two formations each made up of five enemies. The formations are cross-shaped, and at the bottom of each formation is a single laser gun. The laser guns fire a long, dangerous yellow beam at regular intervals. At the same time, the other enemies may break formation and attempt to dive-bomb the player. Destroying a laser gun causes the corresponding formation to break apart. To advance to the next mission, the player must destroy all the enemies.  
Mission 3 - Galaxians: This mission is a clone of "Galaxian". The player is faced with a swarm of galaxians, which continually dive-bomb and shower the player with deadly projectiles. To advance to the next mission, the player must destroy all the galaxians.  
Mission 4 - Space Warp: A wormhole is situated in the middle of the screen out of which enemies ships emerge, one at a time, and spiral outward at increasing speed; whilst growing larger and flinging fireballs at the player. The Space Warp level would have an influence on Konami's superb "Gyruss", released two years later. To advance to the next mission, the player must survive a number of these enemies.  
Mission 5, Flag Ship: The final mission is a one-on-one confrontation with the alien Flag Ship itself. The Flag Ship is one of the earliest examples of the 'boss' enemy in mainstream video games. It is equipped with its own force field, through which the player must blast in order to get a clean shot on the ship. It is also armed with a powerful fireball weapon. The player's weapon has a minor effect on the Flag Ship's hull, and can only blast off tiny pieces of it. This adds to the player's problems, as stray pieces of hull can destroy their ship. These pieces can be destroyed with a single shot. The only way to destroy the Flag Ship is to hit the glowing reactor at the heart of the ship, either by first blasting away the hull to expose it, or by managing to fire a shot directly into the tiny vent that leads to the reactor.  
 
Each time the Flag Ship is destroyed, the player advances in rank. Initially, the player begins with the rank of Space Cadet, before moving on to Space Captain, Space Colonel, Space General, Space Warrior, and finally Space Avenger. The player's spaceship is equipped with a Quark Laser which allows the player to cancel a poorly aimed shot and fire another shot.</desc>

    <desc>Gradius / Nemesis is a horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player pilots a spacecraft known as the Vic Viper as they search through unexplored galaxies looking for a lost armada. These new galaxies are teaming with alien life set upon destroying the Viper.  
 
The game features a power-up system based on a selection meter at the bottom of the screen called a 'power meter', this allows players to 'buy' weapons and upgrades. To achieve this, players must destroy special individual enemies - usually red in colour - or enemy waves that then drop orange capsules. These capsules can be collected and used to upgrade the Viper's weapons. Each collected capsule advances the power meter by one step. Players can activate the highlighted item at any point, after which the power meter resets.</desc>

The Dark Forces led by the god of destruction, Bacterian, prepare to launch a massive onslaught against the planet Gradius. Possessing unstoppable power, the Dark Forces threaten to plunge the Universe into total war and complete annihilation.

Their invasion force smashes the Gradius defenses, and the surrounding planets soon fall like dominoes. Now Bacterian's evil grasp reaches for the heart of the resistance...planet Gradius itself...

To counter the oncoming threat the United Gradius World Forces gather all their fighter craft. Half of them form a defensive net - the other half a strike team. But they are badly outnumbered and The Dark Forces easily tear through their thin frontline. No fighters survive the slaughter....

In a last gasp move, the United Gradius World Forces send out two fighters, previously considered too dangerous for combat missions: The InterDimensional VIC VIPER fighters.

The Fighters take off for the heart of darkness to join the fray that will decide the fate of the Universe...</desc>

Each level is packed with gun-toting bandits and the Sheriff must shoot his way through the stage, before finally taking on the wanted outlaw 'boss' character at the end. Each outlaw wields a special weapon unique to them, such as a Winchester rifle, knives, darts or boomerangs. 
 
Shooting the barrels that litter the levels reveals power-ups such as boots (for extra speed), rifles (for increased range) and bullets (for rapid fire). The game's 3 directional fire buttons (for firing left, right or ahead) can be combined (pressed Simultaneously) to create a total of 8 different firing directions.</desc>

    <name>Gyruss</name>
    <desc>Gyruss is a single-player shoot-em-up in which the purpose is to fly through the solar system, destroying waves of alien attackers, before finally reaching Earth. Planets that must be passed before Earth is reached are Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars.  
 
It only takes two warps to reach Neptune, but all of the others, including Earth, take three warps to get to. Each time the player reaches a planet, they will be faced with a 'Chance Stage', a bonus stage in which players try to destroy as many aliens as possible to accrue points. After reaching Earth, there is a Chance Stage, followed by a very fast '3 Warps to Neptune' stage. After this, the levels and the background music start over.  
 
Gyruss' superb gameplay, in which the player ship rotates around the edges of the screen and fires 'inwards', is heavily influenced by Atari's 1981 classic, "Tempest". While the design of the alien ships themselves is similar to those of Namco's also-legendary "Galaga" series.</desc>

The same hockey rules apply, pass the puck around around the ice rink and shoot it past the opposite goalie to score. You can also check your opponent just like real hockey, only each character has their own bone-crushing way of checking, each with maximum impact and zero tolerance for your well-being.  Players can also start fights with one another to really spice things up. 
 
For an additional credit, players can purchase a 'power drink' that will make them 'Skate Faster and Shoot Harder' at the start of the period for one minute.

    <name>I Robot</name>
    <desc>I Robot is a 3-D shoot-em-up in which the player controls the "Unhappy Interface Robot #1984"; a servant robot who has become self-aware and decided to rebel against the all-controlling Big Brother and his ever-watchful 'Evil Eyes'. 
 
The game is set over a series of platform-based stages constructed from solid coloured blocks and to complete a stage, players must "eliminate the red zones". This is achieved by moving the robot over all of a stage's red surfaces, changing their colour to blue. The colour scheme - including target colour - changes every 26 levels, however. So while the target colour is red for the first 26 screens, it becomes yellow from Level 27, blue from Level 53 and magenta from Level 79. 
 
In order to reach all of the platforms and surfaces, the Interface robot will need to jump. This must be carefully timed, however, as jumping is not allowed under Big Brother's strict regime and his Evil eye - sitting atop a pyramid at the back of the playfield - will open at regular intervals to watch over the interface robot. Should the eye be fully open - indicated by it turning red - when the robot is mid-jump, he will be spotted and destroyed, costing the player a life. 
 
Once all of the coloured squares on a stage have been eliminated, the enemy's shield is destroyed and the Interface Robot will need to be guided to a final, previously inaccessible coloured square at the back of the playfield. The Evil Eye is then zapped and destroyed. 
 
Some levels feature different background elements that affect gameplay, such as walls that must be shot and destroyed to reach coloured tiles, or indestructible moving columns that intermittently block access to coloured tiles, making timing difficult. There are also enemies to be shot or avoided, including birds, bombs and flying sharks.

    <name>Ikari Warriors</name>
    <desc>Ikari Warriors is a vertically-scrolling run 'n' gun shoot-em-up in which one or two players take on the roles of two bandana-wearing musclebound soldiers as they engage in jungle warfare, fighting over land and water to reach the village of Ikari. 
 
Players can rotate their guns through 360 degrees, allowing them to fire and move in all directions. Standing between the soldiers and their destination is a multitude of enemy soldiers, tanks, helicopters and reinforced bunkers.  
 
The enemy soldiers utilise a number of different weapons, including machine-guns, grenades, super grenades and flame-throwers. The game's standard enemy troops wear blue uniforms, but there are also enemies in red uniforms that when killed, often drop power-ups that either give players more ammunition, increase the power of bullets and grenades or even kill all enemies on the screen. The players' munitions are limited in number so additional ammo and grenades must to be picked up along the way.  
 
While most of the action takes place on foot, unoccupied enemy tanks can be found that can be entered and driven. Tanks offer increased firepower as well as resistance to enemy shots. Too many enemy hits, however, will eventually see the tank explode, this is proceeded by a warning flash to allow the player to exit the tank before the explosion. Should the player be caught inside when the tank explodes, a life is lost. Tanks also have a limited amount of fuel but extra fuel can be found to replenish it. 
 
Another obstacle that players need to be wary of, whether on foot or in a tank, are hidden land-mines. These cannot initially be seen put will appear and flash as the player approaches. These cannot be destroyed and contact with them results in an instant death. 
 
Unlike most arcade games, Ikari Warriors is not separated into different stages; the game takes place over one huge, scrolling stage. Ikari Warriors does have a continue feature, but it's only possible to continue from where the last game ended by first holding down the FIRE button, then pressing the start button. Simply pressing the start button restarts the game from the very beginning.</desc>

    <name>Image Fight</name>
    <desc>Image Fight is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up with an original premise. The game's first five stages are supposed to be a 'simulation' and serve as training to test the player's abilities. Player's will receive a penalty if their hit-ratio is too low. 
 
Once players have proved themselves on the opening stages, they will progress to the game's last three stages, blasting off into space on a mission to destroy the alien vegetation surrounding the Moon's main computer. If the player fails in the mission, they must endure the dreaded 'Penalty Zone'. Features a high level of challenge, a wide variety of weapons and the ability to change speed. 
 
If the player's ship is equipped with one or more red/blue extra guns, pushing both Action buttons simultaneously will sling the guns forward in a boomerang-like fashion. This is a powerful and destructive method and can be done an unlimited number of times.</desc>

    <name>Ironman Ivan Stewarts Super Off-Road</name>
    <desc>In his never ending quest for adventure and excitement, man invented off-road racing. These races were then brought before the masses by converting huge sports stadiums into dirt and mud obstacle courses in which off-road 'Ironmen' battled for top honors.  
 
Now the Leland Corporation brings this fast moving, hard driving sport to the video game arena.  
 
Ironman Ivan Stewart's Super Off-Road is stadium off-road racing at it's best. One to three players are asked to test their dirt track skills against the best dirt truck driver in the world.  
 
Contestants compete on eight different tracks with a total of 16 configurations and these courses are packed with enough jumps, bumps, hills, and holes to challenge even the most skillful driver.  
 
Winning drivers earn 'cash' prizes, and use this 'cash' to 'buff out' their machines. At the end of each race, players take their trucks to the 'Speed Shop' to buy better shocks, tires, engines, and higher top speed. They can also buy nitro packs to help them blast over the jumps and through the mud.  
 
The 'Convert-a-Credit' feature allows drivers to add to their winnings by using credits as 'cash'. Each additional quarter, when converted, becomes $200,000 in game 'cash' and this additional 'cash' may be used for purchases in the 'Speed Shop'.</desc>

The player controls a lonely police officer whose job it is to kill the hordes of escaped convicts and, eventually, rescue the kidnapped warden. Each level also has a number of civilian hostages that also roam the levels and need to be rescued. 
 
The player begins the game with only a pistol, but 2 extra weapons, in the form of a bazooka and a tear gas gun, can be collected. The 'Weapon Select' button cycles through the player's weapons via a display at the bottom of the screen. When the desired weapon is highlighted, pressing the Fire button will select and fire the desired weapon. 
 
Hostages will randomly run across the screen and can be rescued by running into them. Should the player accidentally shoot a hostage, all extra weapons will be lost leaving only the pistol.</desc>

The Scarab then lifts off and heads for a point in space that is at the center of a grouping of five planets. (The song that is played in the background during this scene is 'Lights'.) Each group member's instrument is on a different planet.

    <name>Joust</name>
    <desc>Joust is a platform-based action combat game for one or two-players (with the two-player game offering either team-up OR head-to-head combat; the first time arcade gamers were given this choice) in which each player controls a knight riding on the back of a flying ostrich.  
 
The object of the game is to progress through platform-based levels by defeating groups of buzzard-riding enemy knights. This is achieved by 'jousting'; both enemy and player knights carry a lance and must fly around the level (actioned by repeatedly hitting the 'Flap' button) trying to oust rival knights from their steeds by ramming them with the lance. This can only be achieved if the attacking rider is above the enemy knight when the lance connects. A collision of equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing off each other, but if a player is lower than their enemy at the instant of contact, they themselves will be knocked from their steed and lose a life.  
 
A defeated enemy will turn into an egg that falls to the bottom of the screen. This must be quickly collected by players as if the egg lands on a platform and isn't retrieved in time, it will eventually hatch into another enemy knight that must be defeated again.  
 
Joust features three different types of enemy knights - Bounder, Hunter, and Shadow Lord - with each earning players different points values when defeated. A pterodactyl will appear after a predetermined time to hunt the players.  
 
Accurately navigating the player Knights can be initially quite difficult as control is strongly affected by both gravity and inertia. Players can lose a life by either being knocked from their steed by an enemy knight, or by falling into the lava pit at the bottom of each level.</desc>

    <name>Juno First</name>
    <desc>Juno First a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up viewed from a third-person perspective in which players must destroy waves of attacking aliens. Unlike other shooters of the time, the game's enemies don't line up in a gallery formation but instead move freely around the screen. Because of this, the player's ship can move both forwards and backwards (in addition to left and right). 
 
As well as the attacking aliens a spherical 'space capsule' occasionally appears on-screen and if shot, it releases an enemy astronaut that can then be captured. This must be done within a set time, however, with the screen having  a red tint for the period in which rescue is possible. During the capture phase, every enemy the player shoots is worth an additional 200 points.  
 
As a last resort players also have the option to 'warp' to another random part of the play area. This is highly risky as it may place the player's ship in a position more dangerous than the one it left. Players are allowed three warps per level. 
 
Starting formations vary from stage to stage and the aliens mutate into more dangerous forms the longer they survive. To complete a level all aliens must be destroyed.</desc>

Numerous monkeys, the kidnappers of her child, roam the levels set on stopping the player's progress. The monkeys constantly throw apples at the Kangaroo which must either be avoided (either by ducking or jumping, depending on the height of the approaching apple), or punched away, the latter of which allows the Kangaroo to punch the apple back towards the attacking monkey. 
 
If the player stalls for too long or does not punch either an apple or a monkey, a giant ape will appear and steal the Kangaroo's boxing gloves, leaving the player temporarily defenseless. The gloves are returned after a short time. 
 
Fruit and vegetables litter the levels and can be picked up for bonus points. Each level also has a bell hanging from one of its platforms, which can be punched to make fruit and vegetable items appear. The game consists of 4 different stages, once these are completed the game begins again with an increased level of difficulty.</desc>

Flip them from the paddle into the bins, matching the same-colored tiles horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Each line of colored tiles is a Klax. When you've made a Klax, you hear a fanfare. When you complete a wave, the crowd cheers. Let a tile fall in the pit, and you hear a scream as it falls in. If you fail to complete a wave, the crowd is disappointed. Stay alive, complete the waves and don't drop any tiles! 
 
Catch the tiles as they come to the end of the ramp on the paddle. Flip a tile into a bin by pressing the start/flip button. Pull the joystick forward to increase the speed of the closest tile as it klanks down the ramp. Push the joystick back and toss the top tile on the paddle back on the ramp and gain a little time. 
 
The paddle can hold up to five tiles. As long as the green light is on below the paddle, you can pile more tiles on the paddle. When the red light appears, you must flip at least one tile in a bin or toss it back on the ramp before you can collect any more tiles. You can flip tiles into a bin as long as the green light is on below the bin. 
 
To succeed in Klax, make points and also complete each wave. Create a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row of at least three tiles (just like in tic-tac-toe) in the bins to make a Klax and make points. You receive the most points for diagonals, less for horizontals and the least for verticals. When you create a Klax, the tiles in the Klax disappear to make room for more tiles in the bins.

    <desc>A simple shoot-em-up with multiple endings based on your performance in each level. Your guns build up power and get stronger as you tap the fire button rapidly, but the power gauge will drain if you stop tapping the button.  
 
After charging up enough power, you can press the bomb button for a smart bomb attack which uses up the whole power gauge. With more power it creates a bigger explosion.  
 
Power-ups switch your weapon to fire different projectiles, like lasers that spread out at right angles, and a flamethrower that reaches farther with more power.</desc>

The Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect the gold, and contact with any of these will cost you a life. Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once all the gold has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is added. Completing these screens often requires forward planning and precision.</desc>

    <name>Lunar Lander</name>
    <desc>Lunar Lander is a 1-player coin-op electronic game that simulates landing a manned spaceship on the moon. Various video-display phrases indicate score, time elapsed during this landing mission, fuel units consumed, altitude above the moon, and horizontal and vertical speed. The fuel consumption and both speed readings are important for the player to determine how to land the craft. Realistic engine rumble and crash sounds accompany game play. A high beep warns of an almost-depleted fuel supply, whereupon players can add coins to automatically extend the game and 'fill up' their fuel tanks. Depending on the quality of the landing or the crash, various messages are displayed on the screen. 
 
Game play begins with engine rumble and the lander drifting towards the bottom 
right corner of the screen. Horizontal and vertical speeds are constantly displayed, including two arrows to show horizontal and vertical directions of travel. Altitude is measured in distance above the surface of the mountain - not above 'sea level'. The screen also shows time in actual seconds, representing time elapsed in the current mission. 
 
The operator can select from four different settings for fuel units - 450, 600, 750 or 900 fuel units per coin (free play is also available). As the lander module flies over the landscape, it approaches the mountains and a landing site. At a certain point near the mountains, the game 'zooms in' for a close-up view of everything on the screen. 
 
If the player realizes the speed is too fast and the landing looks hopeless, he or she can press the ABORT button on the control panel. This will give the lander extra thrust and make it fly upwards at top speed. The abort feature does consume 120 to 180 fuel units, though, as a disincentive to overusing it. If the ABORT button is pressed too late, however, a crash cannot be avoided. 
 
The four levels of mission difficulty are determined by the player and can be changed at any time during the game or the ready-to-play mode. The differences between the four are printed on the mission select panels and are self explanatory, except perhaps rotational momentum. This feature causes the lander to tumble around when either ROTATE button is pushed. The longer either button is held down, the faster the lander module will spin in that direction. The player gains control of the lander by pressing the other ROTATE button for the same amount of time.</desc>

    <name>Magic Sword: Heroic Fantasy</name>
    <desc>Magic Sword: Heroic Fantasy is a side-scrolling fantasy arcade game released by Capcom in 1990. The player can use a sword, an axe, or magic, and can also rescue and recruit potential allies from different character classes, each with their own special abilities. Three years earlier, Capcom had released the similar Black Tiger in 1987. 
 
Magic Sword is set in a nameless world threatened by the dark lord Drokmar, who is in control of an evil crystal known as the "Black Orb" that would allow him to rule the world. To prevent this from happening, the Brave Hero must climb to the top of the 50-story tower that Drokmar resides in, known as the Dragon Keep. After Drokmar is defeated, the player has the option of two endings: destroy the Black Orb, or take control of it and become the new Dark Lord.</desc>

    <name>Major Havoc</name>
    <desc>Major Havoc is a vector-based shoot-em-up and platform game in which the evil Vaxxian Empire overran the galaxy many years ago. Most of humanity was enslaved and abducted to the Vaxxian home world, although a few human scientists managed to escape. The Vaxxian Empire has long since collapsed but numerous Vaxxian space stations, all blindly controlled and defended by robots, still remain in the galaxy, mindlessly following their original, pre-programmed orders. 
 
The small band of scientists who initially escaped have cloned the great human hero, 'Major Havoc' and tasked him with flying his 'Catastrofighter' through a wormhole in space so that he may lead a clone army against the dreaded Vaxxian robots and to liberate the remnants of humanity by destroying the enemy reactors. The player controls Major Rex Havoc, the leader of this band of clones. 
 
The game is broken down into two distinct gameplay genres. The first is a shoot-'em-up in which the player controls Major Havoc's spaceship against the numerous robot ships that defend the enemy reactors. The ships are encased in a force-field shield which must first be shot and depleted before the ship itself can be destroyed. </desc>

Any seconds that remain on the timer when the finish line is crossed are carried over to the next level.  
 
As well as having to negotiate the marble over treacherous walkways and ramps, numerous obstacles and unfriendly creatures will try to slow the marble's progress or knock it over the edge of a platform, wasting yet more precious seconds until a replacement marble appears. The two-player game has players competing to reach the goal first.

    <desc>Mario Bros. is a superb, single-screen platform game in which the legendary "Mario Bros.", Mario and Luigi, must try to rid each level of a number of pests that have infested the waterworks: Shellcreepers (turtles), Sidesteppers (crabs that need to be hit twice) and Fighterflies (flies that can only be attacked when they touch a platform). 
 
Players can jump upwards to hit the platform above them, which will 'flip' any enemies on the above platform onto their backs. The prone enemies can then be kicked into the water to remove them. A 'POW' button also appears on a number of screen; this can be 'butted' by a player, causing all on-screen enemies to flip onto their backs; as well as destroying any enemy fireballs that may be around. Each POW can only be used a maximum of three times.  
 
As well as the game's enemies, players are also hampered by the huge amount of inertia that comes into play when controlling Mario or Luigi. This is due to the low degree of traction that exists between the Mario brothers and the platforms. On later phases, ice appears on the platforms reducing the amount of traction even further. As the game progresses, water droplets hang below the platforms and freeze into deadly icicles, which will eventually break off and fall.</desc>

Centuries later, however, the world government had sent colonists to Mars which began to solve these problems. At a nearby farm, the Infinity chip was discovered and it revealed all the technology of the advanced civilization. In 2309, a Declaration of Independence has been sent to Earth. Large armies have been amassed on Mars, and a gigantic armada was waiting for any attack from Earth. The Earth government sends out a fleet of battleships followed by a special air raid unit called ACID; ACID is equipped with a new fighter ship known as the Mosquito. Their mission is to enter Mars, stop the rebel violence, locate and destroy the rebel leader, whoever... or whatever it may be...</desc>

It is a sequel to X-Men vs. Street Fighter which replaces most of the X-Men characters with characters from Marvel Super Heroes. In an attempt to balance the previous game's problems, the game engine was altered, although it remained aesthetically the same which is what the game was criticized for. The game was released for the arcade in 1997 
 
Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter features a roster of 17 playable fighters, with nine characters from the Street Fighter universe and eight heroes from the Marvel Universe, It utilizes the same one-on-one tag team format previously employed in X-Men vs. Street Fighter.  
The player chooses a team of two fighters, each sporting their own life gauge; at the start of the match, the first selected character is controlled by the player, while the second character remains off-screen and acts as support.

    <name>Michael Jacksons Moonwalker</name>
    <desc>Based on the movie of the same name, Moonwalker is a scrolling, isometric beat' em up in which Michael Jackson (1958-2009), along with his chimp Bubbles, attempts to save children and defeat the evil 'Mr. Big'. During each round, the player must defeat each and every one of Mr. Big's henchmen and the deadly enemy machines that patrol the levels. This is achieved either by shooting them with Michael Jackson's 'magical energy', or by using his Dance Magic - the game's equivalent of a smart bomb. Some enemies take only one shot to defeat whereas others take several shots before they are destroyed. The longer the player holds down on the fire button, the greater the amount of magical energy Michael can inflict. At the start of each round, the player is given 2 dance magic smart bombs. Towards the end of each round, Michael's pet chimpanzee, Bubbles, will be seen moving about. If Michael touches Bubbles, he will turn into a powerful robot (the 'Moonwalker' of the game's title). After Michael has become Moonwalker, he will be able to shoot lasers and fire missiles. Michael must defeat every boss enemy at the end of each round in order to proceed to the next.</desc>

    <desc> 
Millipede is a 1- or 2-player game with a color raster-scan video display. The game action takes place on a playfield filled with mushrooms, flowers, and deadly DDT bombs. The player tries to destroy a variety of insects that drop from the top of the screen or enter from the sides of the screen, most of them to attack the player. The player controls a bow-shaped vehicle called the Archer. The object of the game is to shoot and destroy as many objects as possible for a high point score, before the player's lives are all used up. 
 
Player control consists of a Midi Trak-Ball control and a FIRE button. The Archer is moved by rotating the Midi Trak-Ball control. The Archer can be moved in all directions, but only within the bottom fifth of the screen. However, the Archer must move around mushrooms, flowers, and DDT bombs, since these are fixed and not 'transparent' objects. Pressing the FIRE button causes the Archer to emit an arrow that travels upward. The Archer may fire one or many arrows (by holding down the FIRE button constantly). But only one arrow will appear on the screen at a time.

    <desc>Missile Command is a one or two-player game depicting the outbreak of a nuclear war. Players must defend six cities from waves of incoming nuclear missiles by launching their own anti-ballistic missiles (ABMs) from one of three missile batteries.  
 
The game is played by moving a cross-hair across the sky and pressing one of three buttons to launch an ABM from the corresponding battery (either Alpha Base, Delta Base or Omega Base). Upon reaching the cross-hair the player's ABM explodes, creating a fireball that lasts for several seconds and destroys any enemy missiles that enter it. Each battery is initially armed with ten anti-ballistic missiles and becomes useless when either all of its missiles have been fired or it's been destroyed by enemy missiles.

DRACULA'S HOUSE 
The player-hero of the game is LITTLE RED, a wily, red-headed boy who chases Dracula throughout his five-story haunted house. Up and down staircases and through Warp Doors leading to secret passageways, Little Red zaps defending bats while attempting to light candles in certain rooms. When a candle is lit a Magic Sword is energized with mystical powers. Little Red must touch the flashing Magic Sword to gain SuperZap power... only a SuperZap will defeat the sly Dracula. 
 
FRANKENSTEIN'S CASTLE 
Little Red enters the eerie castle of the hulking Frankenstein. He pursues Frankenstein around his six-story castle while avoiding the fierce Wolfmen.  The tricky Wolfmen can be zapped, but be careful, they can duck under the zap and attack Little Red. Fewer candles are now available to be lit. Warp doors to secret passageways can be used only when they flash. Special jump-down zones allow Little Red to jump down several levels at once, eliminating any Wolfmen in the way as he descends, but Frankenstein can only be defeated with a SuperZap. 
 
CHAMELEON MAN'S GRAVEYARD 
The greatest challenge yet... to dispatch the sneaky Chameleon Man and his horde of Spiders.  Entering the spooky graveyard, Little Red finds that only one candle is available for lighting which is found in a crypt guarded by giant Spiders. Chameleon Man changes his color to match that of the background and thus becomes invisible. Little Red must pass over one of the Color-Change Spots to change the background color making Chameleon Man visible again. Chameleon Man can do away with Little Red with a flick of his long tongue. Chameleon Man can only be done in with a SuperZap.</desc>

    <desc>Moon Patrol is a horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player takes the role of a Luna City police officer assigned to Sector Nine, home of the toughest thugs in the galaxy.  
 
The player controls a moon buggy that travels over the moon's surface, trying to avoid or destroy any obstacles in its path, including craters, rocks and mines. UFOs attack the buggy from above by dropping bombs, some UFO bombs will create a new crater when they hit the ground, generating a new obstacle to avoid. 
 
The buggy can jump to avoid craters, mines and rocks, it also has both front and vertically-mounted cannons that fire missiles simultaneously. The vertical cannon is to destroy UFOs while the front-cannon can take out obstacles that lie in the buggy's path. 
 
Moon Patrol has five different stages spread over 26 check-points, each designated a letter of the English alphabet. The five checkpoints that denote a new stage are E, J, O, T and Z and each new stage sees a change in background graphics as well as an increase in difficulty. One example of this is the introduction of landmines in the third stage (stage 'J'). 
 
A status panel is displayed at the top of the screen that gives the player useful information. A progress bar showing the five major checkpoints and the player's current position is displayed at the bottom of the panel. Above the progress bar is an indicator of the current checkpoint, the time spent in the stage and three indicator lights: the top light indicates upcoming enemy aerial attacks, the middle one indicates an upcoming minefield and the bottom one indicates enemies approaching from behind. 
 
At the end of each stage bonus points are awarded based on how quickly the stage was completed.

    <name>Mortal Kombat</name>
    <desc>Mortal Kombat, first in the Mortal Kombat series, is a 1-on-1 fighting game featuring a cast of seven different characters. Mortal Kombat took ideas from Capcom's seminal Street Fighter II, such as the game's special moves and projectiles. It also introduced a cast of photo-realistic digitized fighters for players to fight either as or against.  
 
Mortal Kombat characters list: 
JOHNNY CAGE 
KANO 
RAIDEN 
LIU KANG 
SCORPION 
SUB-ZERO 
SONYA BLADE 
 
Battles are fought over the best of three rounds. At the end of a battle, a voice instructs the winner to 'Finish Him/Her!' and players have only a couple of seconds to try and execute their character's 'fatality', which sees the winner killing the loser in a spectacular and grisly fashion.</desc>

    <name>Mortal Kombat 2</name>
    <desc>Mortal Kombat II is a direct sequel to the 1992 original featuring new fighters (increasing the character roster from 7 to 12) and improved graphics.  
 
As with its predecessor, MKII's matches are divided into rounds, with victory awarded to the first player to win two rounds. At the point of defeat, the losing fighter will become dazed and the winner is given the opportunity to execute a 'finishing move'.  
 
Some of the standard fighting moves (moves shared by all characters) have now been expanded or enhanced. A crouching punch has been added and the 'roundhouse kick' is more powerful and now knocks opponents across the screen. Also, the difference in hit boxes between high and low kicks is now more marked.  
 
Additionally, returning characters gain new special moves and MKII marks the first appearence of multiple Fatalities - as well as additional, non-lethal finishing moves - in the series. In addition to the Fatalities of its predecessor, MKII offers 'Babalities' (turning a defeated opponent into a crying baby), 'Friendships' (a non-malicious interaction, such as dancing or giving a gift to the defeated opponent) and stage-specific Fatalities (the winner uppercutting their opponent into an abyss below, spikes above, or a pool of acid in the background).  
 
Each character still shares generic attributes - speed, power, jump height and airtime - albeit with differing hit boxes. The sequel drops the points system of its prequel in favour of a consecutive win tally.</desc>

    <name>Mr Do</name>
    <desc>Mr. Do! is a colourful and addictive maze game in which the player takes on the role of the eponymous Mr. Do, a circus clown, who must clear each level of either cherries or monsters. The game's single screen levels are made up of tunnels surrounded by a colourful, soil-like substance. This soil can be dug through to create new tunnels, allowing Mr. Do to escape his enemies and to reach the many cherries that litter the levels. A number of apples are also scattered around each level, and Mr. Do can push them along tunnels (to block and/or kill monsters) or can tunnel beneath them to drop them onto the heads of any pursuing enemies. Mr. Do himself can also be killed by a falling apple. 
 
Mr. Do is armed with a 'Powerball' that can be fired down a tunnel, it will then bounce around the tunnels until it either returns to Mr. Do, or comes into contact with, and kills, one of the level's monsters. The Powerball regenerates immediately the first time you use it, but takes longer each time it is used to return to your hands. As each level progresses, the monsters themselves start to dig tunnels of their own in their pursuit of Mr. Do. Monsters can also push the apples. 
 
Each screen has a doorway through which the monsters enter the level. Once all of the monsters have appeared, the doorway will turn into a 'prize', (ice cream, biscuits, etc.). If Mr. Do collects the prize, the 'Alphamonster' and his three 'Muncher' henchmen will appear. The Alphamonster may be in the EXTRA box at the top of the screen or be moving around the screen. The Alphamonster and the Munchers cannot be easily crushed under apples because they tend to eat them. They can be killed individually with the Powerball or by killing the Alphamonster itself, at which point any remaining Munchers will turn into apples. 
 
After every three levels, there is a brief intermission in which a tune is played and a large, animated Mr. Do appears, together with some of the game's monsters. The time to complete each level and the preferred method (monsters, cherries, Alphamonsters, or Diamond) is shown. The paths in the first level resemble a 'D', after this each level's tunnels resemble a digit, ('2', '3', '4' etc.) up to '0' for level 10. 
 
A level can be completed any one of several different ways: either by collecting all of the on-screen cherries; by killing all of the monsters, by completing the EXTRA box, or by collecting the diamond. The latter appears only very occasionally ('Special' awards an extra credit).</desc>

Namco introduced a number of changes and enhancements over the original game. The first difference is in the main character. For the first time in video-game history, the game's lead character was female. Ms. Pac-Man is almost identical to the original character with two main differences; she wears a bow in her 'hair', and is also wearing lipstick.  
 
Another change from the original is that the bonus fruit items are no longer static but now move randomly around the mazes.  
 
Ms Pac-Man features four different maze layouts, which alternate every two to four rounds:

    <desc>Professional wrestling experienced a sudden increase in popularity during the early 1980s, where many professional wrestling organizations were started all over the world. A severe rivalry existed among the organizations. 
 
In order to resolve this conflict, 8 organizations combined to form the Capcom Professional Wrestling Association (CPWA), led by Victor Ortega, the CPWA?s first champion. 
 
One day, Ortega suddenly vanished. He was considered to be the axis of the sport and his unexpected disappearance caused the CPWA to enter an age of confusion and disorder. The BPWA, a dark underground wrestling organization, chose to take advantage of this opportunity and began moving. With "Fighters of Muscle Bomber = Destiny" as the theme, the CPWA chief executives decided to hold a world tour called the ?Crash Carnival,? to decide the new king of the CPWA. 
 
The gong that determines the new ?Master of Muscle Bomber? is sounded?</desc>

Players are armed with both Shuriken throwing stars and with a sword for close encounters. Numerous boxes are scattered throughout the levels (or are being carried by enemies), all of which contain bonus items such as weapon power-ups or energy-replenishing food. Other power-ups include an invulnerability shield (known as the "Shinobi Shield") which lasts a few seconds and a "Smart Bomb" power-up, which destroys all on-screen enemies.

    <name>Nemo</name>
    <desc>One night, as Nemo sleeps, he is visited in a dream by the King of Slumberland, who invites Nemo to come and play with the King's daughter, the Princess. Nemo finds himself unable to find the Princess however, so he and 'Flip', a strange companion who also turns up in the dream, decide to explore Slumberland and find the king.

Nemo is a colourful and abstract platform shoot-em-up set in the dream world of Slumberland, a surreal world in which childrens' toys are running amok and must be destroyed. Nemo is armed with a magical staff that emits a burst of magic to destroy the many enemies, some of which require multiple hits. A number of power-ups also appear at regular intervals to aid Nemo in his quest through seven tough stages.</desc>

    <name>New Rally X</name>
    <desc>New Rally-X is a scrolling, overhead mazed-based racing game in which the player drives a racing car around a maze and must collect ten yellow flags before the car's fuel runs out. In-game opponents consist of red enemy cars that pursue and try to ram into and destroy the player's car. The enemy cars are faster moving than the player's vehicle.  
 
The player's car automatically moves in whichever direction the joystick is pushed and if it runs into a wall, it will turn automatically and continue moving. To disrupt the chasing enemy cars a smoke-screen can be activated that trails behind the player's car, causing any pursuing vehicles to crash. Activating the smoke screen uses a small amount of fuel, however, so players must be careful to not overuse it. 
 
Each maze also has rock formations and crashing into these will result in the loss of a player car. A radar display to the right-hand side of the playing area shows the relative positions of the flags, rocks and enemy vehicles.  
 
In addition to the standard ten flags, each maze also contains a special flag (indicated by the letter "S"). If collected, the value earned for the round's remaining flags doubles from 100 to 200 points. If the player dies before the end of that round, the flag value is set back to 100 points and the double bonus is lost.  
 
The mazes also contain a 'lucky flag'. This is marked with the letter 'L' and - providing there are still standard flags remaining - awards the player extra points for remaining fuel, after which the round will continue as normal. Upon completion of a round, bonus points are awarded based on how much fuel the player has remaining. 
 
As players progress through the rounds, the number or pursuing enemy cars increases.</desc>

    <desc>Night Warriors: Darkstalkers' Revenge is the second game in the Darkstalkers series of gothic horror fighting games. Released in 1995, it is the upgraded version of the original game which introduced several gameplay changes to the game. 
 
The game introduced two new playable characters, Donovan Baine and Hsien-Ko, who were out to hunt the other Darkstalkers (hence the Japanese title, Vampire Hunter). The two bosses from the first game, Huitzil and Pyron, were now playable characters as well. The game was first released for arcades and later ported to the Sega Saturn. Character art was done by Ikeno.</desc>

    <name>Ninja Baseball Bat Man</name>
    <desc>Ninja Baseball Batman is an abstract, horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up for in which up to four players control a team of robotic baseball-star ninjas who must fight their way through a variety of levels, defeating the game's many enemies.  
 
The object of the game is to recover a number of artifacts stolen from the Baseball Hall of Fame, a task prescribed to them by the Commissioner of Baseball. Each stage takes place in several parts of the United States, with a boss character appears at the end of each stage. 
 
The game's enemies are themed entirely around the sport of Baseball; taking the form of Baseballs, Catcher's mitts, bats etc. The game also allows players to perform combos, throws and dash attacks against multiple enemies. When a player's health bar flashes red, more moves can be performed as long as the player does not restore or completely lose health.  
 
Health restoring food and drink items appear throughout the game, as well as throwable weapon pick-ups, including baseballs and shuriken. Occasionally players will find a pink heart, collecting this summons cheerleaders who either damage all on-screen enemies or drop a large amount of food. 
 
The four characters of "Ninja Baseball Batman" and their traits are: 
 
Captain Jose - Head of the team and technician. Well-balanced and a good choice for beginners.  
     
Twinbats Ryno - Very fast and wields two bats, but is the weakest of the four. 
     
Beanball Roger - He is a powerful buster, but not as fast as others.  
     
Stick Straw - A long-reach hitter, making him the best choice for long-range moves.</desc>

    <desc>Osman is a side-scrolling action platforming game produced by Mitchell Corp. that was released exclusively to arcades in 1996. Many ex-Capcom staff including Kouichi Yotsui (credited as Isuke), worked on the original arcade version of Strider and designed Osman as an unofficial sequel to Strider. Yotsui directed both titles. 
 
In contrast to Strider's futuristic Kazakh-Soviet setting, Osman is set in a neon-lit cyberpunk Arabian setting, while Strider Hiryu is replaced by a Middle Eastern protagonist named Kirin who fights without any weapons.The game's bizarre plot supposedly mocks director Kouichi Yotsui's experience at Capcom after Strider.

    <desc>Out Run is a ground-breaking racing game in which the player drives a red Ferrari Testarossa through a number of colourful European locations, trying to reach each end-of-level checkpoint before the tight time limit expires. 
 
Each of the game's stages is packed with civilian traffic that must be carefully avoided, as players try to negotiate the game's twisting, hilly roads.  
 
At the end of every stage players are presented with a fork in the road, allowing them to chose which route they wish to take next. This was not the first time this feature had appeared (Tatsumi's 1983 racer, TX-1, was the first to introduce forked roads). 
 
As well as being able to choose routes, players could also - via the game's "in-car radio" - choose one of three different catchy tunes to listen to while driving. The songs are 'Magical Sound Shower', 'Passing Breeze' and 'Splash Wave'.</desc>

    <desc>Prisoners of War is a horizontally-scrolling run 'n' gun platform game for one or two players in which Special Forces soldiers escape from a POW camp and must fight their way through enemy territory to reach the extraction point and rescue.  
 
The escaping POWs fight primarily using hand-to-hand combat, but limited-use knives and sub-machine guns can be retrieved from fallen enemy soldiers. The game consists of three action buttons for punching, kicking and jumping. There are also three special attacks performed by pressing two buttons simultaneously: a jump kick (jump, then kick), a back punch (jump and punch simultaneously) and a headbutt (punch and kick simultaneously). 
 
The controls change when wielding a weapon; the knife is thrown by pressing the punch button, but can preserved by using kicks. When wielding the machine gun, players can fire it by pressing the kick button, or can conserve its ammo by pressing the punch button to gun-whip enemies from close-range.</desc>

    <desc>Pac-Land is a horizontally-scrolling platform game set in the cartoon world of the game's title. A fairy has lost her way and needs Pac-Man to help her get back to her home of Fairyland. Pac-Man, with the fairy safely hidden beneath his hat, must run and jump through the colourful world until he reaches and enters the magical door to Fairyland. Upon being rescued, the fairy gives Pac-Man a pair of magical shoes for his trip back home. These enable him to jump wherever he wants, without the need for a platform to jump from. This effectively means Pac-Man can 'sky-jump' back home if he so wishes. 
 
Directional buttons make Pac-Man walk left and right and it's possible to make him run by tapping the desired directional button twice. Pac-Man is pursued by his ever-present enemies in the form of five ghosts - Pinky, Inky, Blinky, Clyde and Sue. Pac-Man must avoid the ghosts and other deadly objects that populate the levels. As with previous games in the series, a small number of 'Powerpills' appear. Eating a Powerpill makes Pac-Man temporarily invincible and turns the ghosts purple and vulnerable to being eaten. On some stages, Pac-Man must use a springboard to jump over large ponds by leaping from the springboard and rapidly moving left and right while in the air. 
 
The game's stages are called 'trips', with players able to start on any one of the first five. Each trip made up of four rounds (three rounds to reach Fairyland and one round to return home) with a short interval between each one. The objective in all trips is to get the fairy safely back to Fairyland then return home to Pac-Man's family. The majority of the trip involves moving from left to right, avoiding various obstacles such as the enemy ghosts, water spurts and quicksand traps. The journey home, however, scrolls right to left. 
 
Each stage must be completed within a set time limit and if the player runs out of time before finishing a round, Sue (the purple ghost) will speed up considerably and kill Pac-Man. At the end of each round, players are awarded bonus points based on how much of the time limit remains. On each stage, cherries and other items can be collected for extra points. There are a total of 8 different trips in the game, totalling 32 levels. After the 8th trip, the 9th trip is a repeat of the 5th trip, with level 33 effectively being level 17, with an increased difficulty level.</desc>

    <desc>Paperboy © 1984 Atari Games.

Paperboy is a one or two-player game in which the objective is to deliver Newspapers to the Paperboy's customers from Monday through to Sunday. 

Each game begins with ten customers and ten non-customers. Paperboy's customers live in the brightly coloured houses, while non-customers live in dark coloured houses. To deliver to a customer, the player must throw a paper either into the customer's mailbox, or onto their front porch. Failure to deliver a paper to a customer results in the loss of that customer for the next day. Any damage done to a customer's property also results in the loss of that customer. Losing all ten of Paperboy's customers will get him fired and the game is over. However, on any day in which all customers have their papers successfully delivered, one of the non-customers will re-subscribe.

Non-customers' houses and yards are loaded with targets at which to throw your extra papers (windows, lamps, statues, etc.). Hitting these targets earns points for the "Breakage Bonus", which is displayed at the top center of the screen. The total Breakage Bonus is awarded to the player at the end of each day (or at the end of the game-whichever comes first). 

If Paperboy loses a customer, that customer's house will be dark coloured the next day. As a non-subscriber, this house now presents more targets at which to throw newspapers for building up the Breakage Bonus. At the start of each day, a map of Paperboy's route is displayed to indicate subscriber and non-subscriber houses. This helps to remind players of what customers they may have lost on the previous day and the location of remaining customers. 

Paperboy can carry a maximum of ten papers at a time, but can restock his supply by riding over paper bundles placed here and there on his route. A paper supply indicator is displayed underneath the player's score. 

While making his deliveries, Paperboy must avoid collisions with all stationary objects and other characters moving about the neighborhood. To avoid collisions, Paperboy can ride his bike anywhere - on the sidewalk, in the street, or into front yards. A collision with anything results in the loss of a life. 

In addition to the obstacles, non-subscribers are hostile towards Paperboy and will attack him and try to knock him down. If Paperboy damages a subscriber's property, that character may also attack. So the more customers that are lost, the more hostile the neighborhood becomes toward Paperboy. 

At the end of each delivery day, players have a chance to sharpen their skills by guiding Paperboy through the Paperboy Training Grounds. This obstacle course is filled with various targets at which to throw newspaper, as well as ramp jumps to be negotiated. This is a bonus round and no lives are lost for failing to reach the finish line.</desc>

    <desc>Peter Pack Rat is a platform game in which the player, controlling the game's hero, a rat called Peter; must rush around a platform-filled screen collecting a variety of objects to take back to Peter's nest. These objects include bottles, watches, hats, balls, and cans. 
 
A number of enemy creatures hinder the player's progress; these include rats, cats, dogs, bats and owls. There are 3 different levels to play through; a junkyard, a sewer and a tree. 
 
As well as the objects that must be collected and taken to Peter's nest, additional objects can also be collected and thrown to stun attacking animals. Flying animals that have been stunned can be ridden around the screen for a short period of time. A round ends when all the desired objects have been collected and placed in the nest. Successive rounds add more objects and enemies, as well as changing the patterns of the shortcuts.</desc>

    <desc>Phoenix is a classic vertical shoot-em-up in the mould of Taito's "Space Invaders" and Namco's "Galaxian", but takes the concept further with the introduction of progressive stages of play (instead of simply repeating a single playfield over and over with an increasing difficulty level). 
 
According to Centuri's Joel Hochberg, the game was licensed from "a smaller Japanese developer." Amstar Electronics licensed the game to Centuri for manufacture in the United States. Taito released the game in Japan.</desc>

The pig is suspended in a winch-controlled cage and must move vertically up and down, shooting the balloons and sending the wolves plummeting to the ground. Any wolves she misses will, having safely reached the ground, climb a ladder to try and bite her. Also, if any of the wolves reach the ground, more piglets will be captured by them. Mother Pig must try to kill as many wolves as possible without letting them reach the ground. 
 
On the second level, the wolves use balloons to float upwards to the top of a high cliff. If enough of them reach the cliff, they will push a huge boulder down onto Mother Pig's cage. After this level has been completed, the piglets who have been captured are rescued and the game starts over with increased difficulty. 
 
There is also a bonus round where Mother Pig will attempt to eliminate as many wolves on ascending balloons as possible by throwing as few slabs of meat as possible for a maximum bonus score.</desc>

    <desc>Popeye is a superb and demanding platform game featuring characters from the famous King Features Syndicate cartoon show of the same name. The aim of the game is to rescue Popeye's girlfriend, Olive Oyl. This is achieved by catching a set number of objects thrown down by Olive from the top of the screen; such as hearts, letters and musical notes. Popeye is constantly pursued in his quest by love rival, Brutus (originally known as Bluto). Popeye must either run away from Brutus or grab some spinach and punch him off the screen (he will, of course, return). 
 
Should any of Olive Oyl's items fail to be caught, they will fall into the water at the bottom of the screen. Popeye will then have only a few seconds to retrieve the object or a life is lost. Several other Popeye characters also make an appearance in the game; namely Wimpy, Swee'Pea, the Sea Hag, and her vulture Bernard. The game's three levels are the dock scene, the street scene and the shipboard scene. These repeat with increasing difficulty.</desc>

    <desc>In a time when the industrialization of the world had just begun, various inventions appeared and changed the life of the peaceful kingdom. One of them was a propeller that evolved from pure wind generation by using the created electricity to re-rotate it. It was called 'The Professional Gear', or just 'Progear'. This invention was the key to conquer the great wide open sky. Another discovery made the ancient dream of the immortal body come true. But it was affordable only by some wealthy elderly. They formed a new council called 'the Motorouin' and declared the current government as a corruptive and greedy establishment and that they want to correct it by a new educational system, in order to create a new race of man. So they built a military force to realize the first step of their plan, which was the takeover of the kingdom. The government decided to stop the aggression by putting it's own army in motion. It was a dreadful battle with many victims. But it was won by the Motorouin. This battle is mentioned in the books of history as 'The Punishment of the Sages'. 
 
A group of young pilots, actually children whose families were killed in that war, finally decided to fight back. They secretly developed a new powerful weapon which adults were not able to use. They called it 'Gun Flyer' and installed it in all of their planes. The Storm of Progear was about to begin!</desc>

The player's opponents are each rendered as humorous cartoon-like caricatures - adding much to the game's atmosphere - and each boxer fights in a slightly different style, forcing players to adapt to their strategy.

The opposing two-man teams face off for a match played in four quarters (2 to 5 minutes each), on improvised courts in 3 different locations: the alley, the park, and the harbor.

Naturally, it ain't just about being cool and shooting some b-ball outside of the school: on each side you have a couple of guys who are up to no good, with a constant enthusiasm for making trouble in the neighborhood. As such, Punk Shot joyfully turns basketball into a full-contact sport - heads will be bashed, noses punched, and private parts kicked. To top it off, each court features an assortment of environmental hazards, from slippery banana peels and having your butt set on fire, to the park dogs and their special taste for pants.</desc>

Players can hinder their opponent by forming Puyo combinations; a successfully formed chain removes some some of the player's Puyos and causes 'junk' Puyos to fall into the opponent's play area. As these Junk Puyos are transparent, they cannot be used to form a chain and can only be destroyed when a nearby chain is created.</desc>

    <desc>Puzz Loop is a puzzle game for one or two players in which different coloured marbles continually roll down a spiral path towards a central goal line. 
 
Players control a rotating cannon situated at the center of the spiral and must stop the line of marbles from reaching the goal by shooting matching coloured marbles into the line. If three or more marbles of the same colour are matched, they will disappear. 
 
In addition to standard marbles, bonus marbles occasionally appear that will, for example, temporarily slow down the rate the marbles' advance, or cause all marbles of a certain colour to be destroyed. Also, providing there is a clear line of sight, unwanted marbles can be fired straight out of the play area to prevent them from adding to the advancing line. 
 
All marbles must be destroyed to complete a level. The game is over once the marbles are pushed over the goal threshold.</desc>

At the start of each level, the playing field is just a large, empty rectangle, containing the Qix - a stick-like entity that performs peculiar, erratic motions within the confines of the rectangle. The player controls a small marker that can move around the edges of the rectangle. To claim an area of the screen, the player must detach from an edge and draw Stix within the rectangle. Stix are simply lines traced out by moving the marker. When the marker traces out a closed shape, the area enclosed by the shape becomes solid and has been claimed. The player may draw either Fast Stix, which appear blue when solid, or Slow Stix, which appear red. Slow Stix take longer to draw, but are worth twice as many points. Once the player has claimed an area, the marker can safely move along the border of that claimed area. To complete a level, the player must claim 75% or more of the rectangle's area.</desc>

The game-play has a similar feel to another Namco legend, "Pac-Man"; although in Rally-X, the mazes are much larger and, with each maze having only ten flags to collect, is more sparsely populated than Namco's pill-eating legend. 
 
In-game opponents consist of red enemy cars that try to ram into and destroy the player's car, a problem compounded by the fact that enemy cars are faster than the player's. A smoke screen can be activated which trails behind the player's car and causes any pursuing enemies to crash. Each maze also has rock formations which, if crashed into, will result in the loss of a player car. A radar display to the right hand side of the playing area shows the positions of both the flags, and the enemy vehicles.</desc>

    <desc>Ring of Destruction: Slam Masters II, is the 1994 sequel to Saturday Night Slam Masters and the second game in the series. It was not ported to home consoles. 
 
Unlike the first game, which played like a traditional wrestling game, Ring of Destruction's format was changed to play like a traditional one-on-one 2D fighting game (similar to Super Street Fighter II), with the action restricted to one plane. The game's configuration was changed to a five-button setup (two punch buttons, two kick buttons and a grappling button). The objective of each match is to deplete the opponent's life bar in two out of three rounds. It is no longer necessary for the player to pin their opponent to win a match, although all the other moves have been retained.

    <name>Robocop</name>
    <desc>RoboCop - The Future of Law Enforcement is a single player, side-scrolling platform shoot-em-up based on the 1987 movie of the same name. The game's story mirrors that of the film, with former cop Murphy, now a half-human cyborg called 'RoboCop', on a quest to bring down the evil OCP corporation. 
 
RoboCop features nine levels of action, with two of the game's nine stages being into-the-screen target ranges, in which players can try to accrue bonus points and earn extra health. Wooden crates occasionally bar RoboCop's progress, but these can be punched to remove them. Marked crates can be smashed to reveal one of three Weapon power-ups; Three-way Gun, Dual Laser and the incredibly powerful Cobra Gun. 
 
The film's incidental music plays throughout the game and RoboCop's speech is sampled directly from the original film.</desc>

    <name>Robotron: 2084</name>
    <desc> 
Set in the year 2084, Robotron is a single-screen shoot-em-up in which super-intelligent self-aware robots known as 'Robotrons' - designed and built to help mankind - have revolted against their creators and vowed to either reprogram the humans into Robotrons or, failing this, wipe-out the human race entirely.  
 
The player must destroy the robots and rescue the Earth's remaining human families. The player's only weapon is a multi-directional Anti-Robot Laser Gun. Used effectively, it will give players the power to destroy all the Robot waves, with the exception of the indestructible 'Hulk' unit.  
 
At the start of the attack wave, players will have three chances to wipe out the enemy and advance to the next wave. Every 25,000 points players are granted another chance to complete their mission.  
 
MAN, WOMAN, CHILD: These are the only three types of human clones left on Earth. Defenseless and easy prey to the Robots, they are totally dependent upon players for their survival and will wander aimlessly until the player makes contact with them. Touching them will place them under the player's protective powers and earn them the following points: 1,000 for rescuing the 1st human; 2,000 for the 2nd: 3,000 for the 3rd; 4,000 for the 4th; 5,000 for the 5th; and 5,000 for every additional human saved. At the beginning of each new wave and when the player loses a turn, rescue scoring will again begin at 1,000.

    <name>Roc n Rope</name>
    <desc>Roc'n Rope is an incredibly difficult yet playable platform game featuring four different levels. The player takes on the role of a an archaeologist whose mission is to return the missing tail feathers to the golden Phoenix. The archaeologist is armed with a harpoon gun and uses it to fire a rope into a platform above, in order to climb up the rope and progress up the level. This is vaguely similar to the superb 'telescopic arm' feature that appeared in Capcom's superb "Bionic Commando". 
 
All levels are patrolled by enemies in the form of dinosaurs and cavemen and all are deadly to the touch. Some cavemen will pull on the harpoon rope while the archaeologist is climbing it. This will result in the player falling from the rope and losing a life. The archaeologist is armed with a light ray that will kill the enemies. 
 
A breakdown of the game's four levels: 
 
The first level is possibly the most difficult in the game. Players begin at the bottom left of the screen and must work their way up to the Roc, who is sitting at the upper right of the screen. There are many layers of ledges coming out from the sides of the screen. While the middle of the screen is open to the sky (except for a few floating platforms). To reach the top, players must use the harpoon gun to climb diagonally back and forth until they reach the top (ensuring that the Phoenix feathers have been collected on the way). 
The second level is set underground. There are a lot of dinosaurs on this screen and far fewer platforms than on the first level. Many of the platforms stretch completely across the screen, so there aren't many pitfalls to be wary of. Once again, players must get the archaeologist to the top of the screen to complete the level. 
The third level is set outdoors. A 'ferris wheel' style rotating platform sits in the center of the screen, but this can be avoided if players don't wish to use it. The easiest route to the top is on the right-hand side of the level. 
The fourth and final level is shaped a little like a mountain. The player's main concern here is a large waterfall in the center of the screen. Players must time their harpoon climb just right to avoid being killed by the deadly waters. Once this level is finished, the game starts over with an increased level of difficulty.</desc>

    <name>R-Type</name>
    <desc>RType is a sideways-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the evil Bydo Empire rules the galaxy through fear and intimidation and it's up to the player - piloting their heavily-armed R-9 space ship - to battle through eight tough levels to the heart of the Bydo stronghold and defeat them. 
 
The game's revolutionary weapons system is its real stroke of genius. The first of numerous innovations that R?Type bought to the genre is the beam weapon: when the fire button is held down, a 'power meter' starts to charge up; once the meter is full, releasing the fire button unleashes a very powerful plasma burst capable of inflicting much greater damage to enemy ships or even destroying numerous enemies simultaneously. The trade-off is that charging the weapon takes up valuable seconds, giving the Bydo ships time to attack. 
 
The most significant addition to R-type's arsenal is the now-legendary 'Force Pod'. This takes the form of an invincible, detachable laser-firing pod that can be attached to either the front or rear of the player's ship, or can be detached completely, after which the pod sits some distance either ahead or behind the player's ship, tracking its movements and providing additional fire power. When attached to the R9 ship, the pod acts as a shield. This forms a crucial part of R?Type's gameplay and has to be fully utilised to navigate certain sections of the game, such as the huge mothership that comprises the game's 3rd stage. 
 
R?Type's levels are designed to make full use of its unique weapons system, making for very linear and demanding gameplay in which losing or picking up the wrong weapon at the wrong time often leads to an instant death. Its intelligent, precise and demanding level design, gave the world its first truly 'strategic' shoot-em-up.</desc>

    <name>R-Type II</name>
    <desc>The sequel to the hugely successful original finds the evil Bydo Empire once again intent on the destruction of all mankind in this sideways scrolling, six-level shoot-em-up. 
 
The innovative weapons system of the original game - the 'Beam Weapon' and 'Force Pod' - make a welcome return and remain unchanged for the sequel. 
 
The tight, demanding gameplay and high emphasis on correct usage of the weapons system also return - although the sequel is, if anything, even more demanding than its already unforgiving predecessor; with more durable enemies and trickier level design.  
 
R?Type II features three new weapon shot types:  
Green - Search Laser - fires semi-homing lasers that can bend at 45Â° angles.  
Grey - Shotgun Laser - fires large shells that travel a short distance before exploding powerfully.  
Scatter Bomb - drops bombs to the ground; when these explode, the explosion scatters forwards along the ground. This is a supporting weapon that can be equipped instead of missiles. 
 
In addition to the new weapons, R-type II's Beam Weapon has received an upgrade. As with the first game, holding down the fire button makes a power gauge fill up, releases the button then unleashes a powerful plasma shot. For the sequel, however, continuing to hold down the button causes the gauge to charge up further. This 'double-charged' gauge flashes blue and red and releases an even more powerful plasma burst.</desc>

    <name>R-Type Leo</name>
    <desc>R-Type Leo is a horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up and is the third and final arcade release of this classic series (although numerous console-only sequels would follow, see 'Series' for details). 
 
Mankind are currently at peace with their former adversaries, the Bydo Empire, and have taken the opportunity to undertake a massive project called 'Project Paradise'. This involved the construction of an artificial terrestrial-like planet called 'Eden', created as a safe haven should humanity once again find itself under threat. However, soon after construction is completed, 'Major' - the bio-computer system responsible for maintaining Eden - malfunctions, taking control of the planet's defences and launching an attack on mankind. It is up to the newly-developed 'R-9 Leo' fleet to fly in and stop Major's assault on its creators. 
 
R-Type Leo deviates from the gameplay style of its predecessors by removing the use of both the 'Force Pod' and the 'Wave Cannon'. The new weapons are called 'Force Bits' (later identified in "R-Type Final" as "Psy Bits") and the 'Bit Shot'. The three 'Force Bit' weapon types are: 
Red - Claw Laser: a powerful horizontal laser beam and horizontal traverse wave 
Blue - Mirror Laser: fires multiple, ricocheting lasers. 
Green - Search Laser LRG: fires semi-homing lasers that can bend at 90 degree angles. 
 
Unlike previous 'Bit' devices, the 'Force/Psy Bits' are capable of firing either forwards or backwards (their direction dictated by the movement of the ship itself). Finally, the 'Wave Cannon' is replaced by a 'Bit Shot', in which the Psy Bits detach from the ship and collide with the nearest enemy. The Bits can only do this for a limited time before running out of energy, and must be recalled to the ship to recharge. 
 
R Type Leo consists of 6 stages and is the first game in the series to allow 2 players to play simultaneously.</desc>

    <name>Rush-n Attack</name>
    <desc>Green Beret is a sideways-scrolling action/platform game set during the Cold War, in which a US Special Forces Marine must infiltrate a Russian military base to save four POW's from being executed by firing squad.  
 
Initially, the soldier is armed with only a combat knife, but by killing the certain enemy troops, players can obtain either a three-shot flamethrower, a four-shot RPG, or a three-pack of hand grenades.  
 
The Marine can jump or lie down to avoid the enemy bullets, as well as climbing ladders to avoid enemies and projectiles, as well as the flashing land mines that litter the levels. While it's possible to remain still in one area to rack up points, if players take too long to proceed, the game will start sending out tougher enemies and eventually a stealth-like bomber will appear to take out the player. There is also an unseen time limit that will kill off players if they take too long to complete the stage.  
 
The game has four stages in total: a missile base, a harbour, an air Base and a Siberian POW Camp. At the end of each stage the Marine will face a group of enemies specific to that stage: Stage 1 ends with a truckload of running and jump-kicking soldiers, Stage 2 with a pack of fierce dogs and their handlers, Stage 3 with three Gyro-copters and Stage 4 with a number of multi-shot flamethrower operators.  
 
The game is completed once the captives have been rescued at the end of the fourth stage, after which the action starts over with an increased level of difficulty.</desc>

    <name>Salamander</name>
    <desc>Salamander is a 1 or 2 player sequel to 1985's superb shoot-em-up, "Nemesis". While it retained the same basic gameplay and feel of its predecessor (particularly the superb and innovative weapons system), Salamander featured both superior graphics and a more imaginative approach to level design. The earliest example of the latter appears towards the end of the very first level, in which imposing, organic obstructions grow before the players' eyes. The game's third level - the infamous 'lava' level - is another good example of Salamander's superb design; with huge solar flares constantly erupting both above and below the player's ship that must be carefully navigated to avoid instant loss of life. Salamander introduced further variety to the action with the introduction vertically-scrolling levels, which alternated with the standard side-scrolling levels. 
 
Salamander's weapon power-up system is as follows: 
SPEED UP: Five speed levels. 
MISSILE: Press missile button to launch. 
LASER: Your forward rockets turn into deadly lasers. 
RIPPLE LASER: Use shoot button to fire. 
FORCE FIELD: Protect your ship with barriers. 
MULTIPLE: Increase your fire power by up to four times. 
 
Multiple special powers can be obtained, but the LASER cannot be used in conjunction with the RIPPLE Laser.</desc>

    <name>Satans Hollow</name>
    <desc>Satan's Hollow is a 1- or a 2-player game. When playing this game, the Rocket Launcher is under YOUR control. YOU make it move back and forth across the screen to launch Rockets that will eliminate your attackers. These attackers are displayed in groups, called 'racks', across the top of the screen. The first rack is made up of a small number of attackers. The second rack is made up of a larger number of these attackers. And intermixed with the racks of attackers is a rack with only a single fire-breathing Devil's head.  
 
The attackers and the Devil's Head will try to wipe out your Rocket Launcher. If they do, you lose one player. In emergencies, you have a Shield which goes all around your Rocket Launcher for a short period of time. It is activated by pushing the Shield button on the control console. BUT BE CAREFUL!! This consumes a lot of power and will only last a VERY SHORT TIME!  
 
Each attacker eliminated will cause a Bridge Section to appear at the lower left corner of the screen EXCEPT: when there is already a Bridge Section there or when you have a Bridge Section in tow under your Rocket Launcher. Pick these Sections up with your Rocket Launcher and move them over to build a Bridge across the gorge at the right side of the screen leading into the land of SATAN.  
 
When you complete your Bridge into the land of SATAN, you can cross it and do battle with him. If you win you will be rewarded by increased fire power for your Rocket Launcher. If SATAN defeats you, you lose one player.  
 
As your skill level increases, the number of attackers is increased and the speed that the fire-breathing Devil's Head moves is increased also.  
 
Bonus Rocket Launchers are awarded to you periodically throughout the game as you reach or pass certain preselected point values. Each attacker has an assigned point value.  
 
The object of the game is to HAVE FUN while constantly improving your skills as you play, eliminating as many attackers as possible each time to get the highest score.</desc>

    <desc>Shadow Force is a side-scrolling platform beat-em-up for one or two players, who choose to play as one of four Ninjas and must use all the means at their disposal to free the world from the grip of the evil Dr. Wong and his terrifying 'Theaser' organization. 
 
Shadow Force has 6 buttons: 2 for punches (low and high) 2 for kicks (low and high) 1 for jumping and 1 for possessing an enemy. Additional attack moves can be utilised by moving the joystick up or down and pressing punch and kick buttons. It's also possible to combine punch and kick attacks to obtain different combos and while the enemies can do the same, the number and variation of their attacks is generally lower than those available to the players. 
 
In addition to being able to possess nearby enemies, Shadow Force also features something else new to the side-scrolling beat-em-up genre; at the end of each stage players take part in a bonus round consisting of a one-on-one fight.  
 
Players can choose to start on any one of the first three stages and the game features 14 different possible endings.</desc>

    <desc>Shinobi is a scrolling platform beat-em-up in which the player takes on the role of Joe Musashi, a Shinobi Ninja, who must fight his way through 5 tough missions - each made up of between 3 to 5 stages - in his quest to rescue the kidnapped Ninja children of the Iga clan; now hostages of an evil Ninja syndicate called "Zeed". To complete a mission, the player must rescue all of the kidnapped children on each level, with the number of hostages remaining displayed on a meter in the bottom left corner of the screen. 
 
Shinobi was a huge success for Sega, and deservedly so. Its perfectly realized blend of platform and fighting action and is as fine an exponent of the 'easy to get into, difficult to master' gameplay ethic as video games have seen.</desc>

Side Arms is a horizontally - and occasionally vertically - scrolling shoot-em-up for one or two players. Each player has two fire buttons, one for shooting ahead and one for shooting behind; crucial for a game in which enemies attack from all directions. Shooting certain enemies will reveal power-ups - displayed as 'POW' icons - and shooting the icons will either change their type, or reveal a special weapon. </desc>

Keep the galaxy safe for all its sinizens! Fiendish Worker ships from the planet Sporg will attempt to fabricate a Sinistar from the remains of derelict planetoids in your very sector. You must not let them do this for two reasons:  
1) These planetoids contain the life-sustaining crystals that your civilization requires for its vital technologies.  
2) With the eminently unstable Sinistar in their possession, the Sprogites can lay waste to any civilization in your sector. You alone stand in their way.  
 
You must mine the sinisite crystals. Williams has equipped you with the latest heuristic electret cannon technology. All you need to do is aim at a planetoid and shoot. Now collect your motherlode!  
 
In fact, only with sinisite can you manufacture sinibombs to eradicate the Sinistar. But you must also rebuff the Workers and disintegrate their even more aggressive comrades-at-arms, the evil skelomorphic Warriors! Intelligent beings everywhere depend on your courage, your dedication, your reserve, your shrewd command of tactical invention! It's up to you, space cadet!</desc>

    <desc>Secret Agent is a side-scrolling platform shoot-em-up which the player takes on the role of a James Bond-esque secret agent who must fight his way through a terrorist group called 'CWD' to reach the final Boss confrontation and prevent a stolen nuclear missile being launched. 
 
The player starts the game armed only with a pistol, and this has a limited amount of ammunition. Once the ammo has run out, players can only kick their enemies. Machine guns are occasionally dropped by defeated enemies and can be picked up and used. Also, Golden Gun components are sometimes dropped; there are six of these in total and once all have been collected, the player is rewarded with a very powerful golden rifle. This weapon kills all enemies instantly but will only last for twenty-five seconds, indicated by a meter at the top-right of the screen. 
 
Most of the game's eight stages are platform-based, but there are also two underwater scuba levels and a motorbike chase. All of the game's end-of-level bosses reappear on the final 'underground lair' level. 
 
While not officially licensed as a James Bond game, Secret Agent is unmistakably meant to represent both the Bond character and movie series. The Bond villain Jaws shows up at the end of stage two and another famous Bond villain, Odd Job also appears. Another memorable Bond reference is the use of a Shaun Connery impersonator who tells players that they have done a Great job upon completion of a level.</desc>

    <name>Smash TV</name>
    <desc>Smash TV is a single-screen shoot-em-up for one or two players and is set in a futuristic game show in the year 1999. Contestants must enter enclosed arenas and compete to collect prizes, money and keys, while fighting to stay alive as they are attacked on all sides by waves of enemies.  
 
The game is a sequel to the legendary "Robotron: 2084" and like its prequel, utilises a dual joystick control system, with the left stick controlling player movement and the right controlling the direction of fire.  
 
Enemy waves enter each arena from four directions via open doorways and all must be killed before players can progress to the next stage. Some arenas feature static gun emplacements set into a wall that must also be destroyed. Power-ups that improve weapons, speed and armour appear at regular intervals, although each only lasts for a limited time. 
 
Smash TV is broken down into stages, each with a set number of arenas. Tough end-of-level bosses await at the end of each stage. As well as the prizes and power-ups, keys can be collected and if enough have been picked up by the end of the game, players can access a bonus level called the Pleasure Dome.</desc>

    <name>Snow Bros - Nick and Tom</name>
    <desc>One or two players take on the roles of snowmen Nick and Tom as they battle a variety of monsters over fifty platform-based, single screen levels.  
 
The snowmen can throw snowballs at the enemies with the aim of encasing them completely in snow. The encased enemies can then be kicked in order to destroy them and this is achieved by standing next to the snowball and pressing the "kick out" button. This sends the giant snowball flying around the screen, killing any enemies that lay in its path.  
 
If players take too much time to complete a stage, an evil pumpkin head will appear and try to kill them. The pumpkin is invincible but can be stunned with snowballs. After a short time the evil pumpkin will spawn ghosts that can travel freely around the stage as they seek out Nick and Tom. These ghosts can't be killed or stunned, so the player's only hope is to avoid them while eliminating the remaining standard enemies, to move on to the next screen as soon as possible. 
 
When players defeat an enemy, it may drop a coloured potion bottle. These can be picked up and act as power-ups: 
Yellow = Long shot 
Red = Speed up 
Blue = Bigger snowballs (encases monsters quicker) 
Green = Inflates the players like a balloon and lets them fly around the screen, killing any monsters they touch. 
 
Every 10th level features a battle with a large end-of-level boss.</desc>

    <name>Solomons Key</name>
    <desc>Solomon's Key is a single player platform/puzzle game in which the wizard Dana is on a quest to retrieve Solomon's key and vanquish the demon hordes that have broken through into his world. To achieve this Dana must advance through the fifty rooms of 'Constellation Space', before finally reaching the magical key. 
 
Dana is armed with a magic wand that can be used to both destroy and create granite blocks, while blocks situated directly above Dana's head can be destroyed by repeatedly jumping up into them until they shatter. The blocks act as platforms, as well as barriers to defend Dana from the numerous patrolling enemies. Each room contains a golden key, retrieving this automatically opens the room's exit door and players must then try to find/create a safe route past the constantly spawning demons to reach the exit and progress to the next room.  
 
Bonus Items - some hidden inside pre-existing granite blocks - are scattered throughout each room. Collecting these earns the player extra points. Power-ups can also be found, these appear as potion bottles with a flame emblazoned on them and a maximum of three can be carried at any one time. When a potion is used, Dana shoots a fireball which will move along the walls and platforms until it hits and kills the first demon it comes into contact with. 
 
As well as bonus items and power-ups, each room also contains a hand-bell. When collected this triggers the release of a trapped fairy, the fairy will then slowly fly around the room and can be rescued for bonus points. An extra life is awarded for every ten fairies rescued. 
 
The game's levels are based on Zodiac star constellations. The main levels are divided into groups of four - making a total of fourty-eight standard rooms - with each group representing a separate constellation. In addition to the standard rooms, each constellation also has a secret bonus room that can only be accessed by finding the given constellation's 'Seal', which is located in the last room of each group. There are three further secret rooms - 'Page of Time', 'The Page of Space' and the 'Princess Room' - that are only accessible if the player has found the 'Hidden Seals of Solomon'. 
 
The four room groups are: 
1-4 Aries 5-8 Taurus 9-12 Gemini 
13-16 Cancer 17-20 Leo 21-24 Scorpio 
25-28 Libra 29-32 Virgo 33-36 Sagittarius

    <desc>Son Son is a 2-D sidescrolling platformer. The screen scrolls automatically, only stopping to fight major enemies. The screen features six continuous platforms that occasionally feature small gaps. Sonson and Tonton walk automatically across these platforms. Pressing up or down will cause them to jump up or down to the next platform. Pressing left causes them to move more slowly than the screen scrolls, essentially continuing to move forward but at a reduced pace. Pressing right does the opposite - SonSon and TonTon will move across the platforms faster than the screen scrolls. The duo have only one attack - the ability to fire energy blasts from their staves. Touching an enemy or an unfriendly projectile causes the player to lose a life. If a player has any additional lives, they will return to the screen riding on a cloud that will give them temporary invincibility. If the player presses the control stick in any direction, the cloud will disappear and the character will resume its usual walking mode. The cloud will eventually disappear on its own if the control stick is not used.</desc>

The game's enemies are as abstract as its setting; with creatures including prehistoric Mammoths, alien pods, giant mushrooms and, at the end of most stages, a huge, fireball-spitting Chinese Dragon. 
 
The player's on-screen counterpart carries a portable jetpack under his arm which allows him to fly. The player can also run along the ground to avoid overhead structures and enemies. 
 
In addition to its flight capability, the jetpack is also equipped with a laser, used to destroy both the game's many enemies as well as some (but not all) obstructions, such as the trees and floating rocks on the first stage. 
 
Space Harrier has a total of 18 stages, each with a boss fight at the end. Three exceptions are the bonus stages (5th and 12th) and the 18th stage, which is a 'boss rush' featuring some of the bosses encountered up to that point.</desc>

The object of the game is to travel the freeways and waterways, hunting down and destroying as many enemy vehicles as possible, all the while not harming civilian vehicles. The view is top-down and the screen scrolls vertically underneath the player's car. 
 
The game begins with the player driving the G-6155. Soon, the player starts to encounter enemy vehicles which try to force the player's car off the road and crash. Each enemy vehicle has its own special feature, such as tire slashers or bulletproof armor. 
 
Points are scored for driving on the road and for destroying enemy vehicles. There is a lead-in time when the player has an endless supply of cars. After this time expires, the player will lose a life each time the car crashes. Extra cars can be earned with high scores. The first extra car is earned at a default value of 30,000 points, but this value can vary depending on settings.

    <name>Star Castle</name>
    <desc>Star Castle is a 1- or 2-player outer space action game designed with features geared for maximum player appeal: A progressively difficult competitive level and a clearly defined enemy which must be both attacked and avoided at various points in the course of play. 
 
The center of the playfield is occupied by the Star Castle which is programmed to constantly home in on the players' ships. Surrounding the Star Castle are three concentric energy rings of twelve segments each, which serve as both a protective perimeter for the Star Castle and a source of points for the player. Contained within the energy rings are three protective mines which seek out the players' ships and destroy them upon collision. The movements of the mines are programmed to simulate the actions of heat-seeking missiles. 
 
The object of the games of Star Castle is to score the maximum number of points possible. This is accomplished by the combination of three elements: 
a) Exploding the ring segments. 
b) Exploding the Star Castle. 
c) Avoiding the Star Castle's mines. A player's turn is over when his ship has been destroyed. The number of ships per game is set by the operator. 
 
For maximum scoring, a player will want to shoot out sections of the energy rings in order to give him a shot at the Star Castle in the center of the screen. As play progresses, there are 2 facts a player must keep in mind: 
1) Exploding all segments in a given ring will cause the entire ring to reappear - thereby eliminating a potential shot at the Star Castle in the center. 
2) Exploding the rings in a manner that gives you a shot at the Star Castle will also give the Star Castle a shot at you. The Star Castle is programmed so that its nose always seeks out the player's ship. If there is an open shot at the player, it will take it. 
 
When the Star Castle is hit by a player's missile, it will first implode and then explode with all remaining ring segments. After a one-second delay, the Star Castle will reappear with all three ring segments. If the Star Castle shoots the player, his turn is over. 
 
As play begins, the Star Castle will appear in the center of the screen surrounded by its 3 energy rings. The player's ship appears about halfway up on the right hand edge. By using the control buttons to move forward, right or left, the player maneuvers about the screen using the firing button to launch missiles. 
 
Points are scored by destroying the energy ring segments or the Star Castle itself. Exploding the Star Castle gives an extra ship as well as points. No points are given for the mines that attack the player. 
 
The player's ship can be destroyed in 2 ways: By collision with the mines or by a hit from the Star Castle's torpedo. The mines are launched from the rings and attack the player for approximately ten seconds or until shot. The Star Castle's torpedoes are launched only when there is a clear shot at the player through all 3 rings. At this time the player also has his shot at the Star Castle. Both the Star Castle and the mines get smarter and faster as the game progresses. 
 
The game of STAR CASTLE is not based on time units. The battle rages on until all the players' ships are destroyed. The length of the game depends solely on the skill of the player. It's the age-old challenge of man versus machine.</desc>

    <desc>Star Wars is a single-player 3-D shoot-em-up based on the legendary movie franchise of the same name. This game is specifically based on the very first Star Wars movie, 'Episode IV: A New Hope'. The player takes on the role of Luke Skywalker (Red Five) whose goal is to blow up the infamous "Death Star" by firing a Proton Torpedo into an exposed exhaust port situated on the Death Star's surface.  
 
Before reaching the exhaust port, players must survive three attack phases.  
 
PHASE 1: The game begins in outer space above the Death Star. Players must engage in a dog fight with Darth Vader and numerous enemy TIE Fighters. All but Vader's fighter can be shot and destroyed. Incoming enemy fire must be avoided or shot to prevent damage to the player's Deflector shields.  
 
PHASE 2: The X-Wing flies down to the surface of the Death Star and is confronted with a barrage of laser turrets and towers as the X-Wing flies across the Death Star's surface. Any collisions with either the towers or incoming enemy shots will cause damage to the player's Deflector Shields.  
 
The laser tower tops have a progressive scoring incentive that is displayed at the top center of the screen, along with the number of remaining laser tower tops that need to be destroyed before the X-Wing enters the exhaust port trench. If the player manages to destroy all of the towers, a sizeable point bonus is awarded.  
 
PHASE 3: The X-Wing begins its approach down the trench of the Death Star, heading for the exhaust port situated at the end of the trench. The trench walls are lined with red laser-gun turrets that fire at the player as he makes his approach. Incoming fire must either be avoided or shot. Trench catwalks of varying shapes and heights also appear in later trench runs. These must be avoided as any collision results in damage to Red 5's deflector shields.  
 
If the player survives the trench run, the voice of 'Han Solo' will advise that 'You're all clear, Kid' and the player must quickly shoot the exhaust port to destroy the Death Star. If a trench run is completed without the player having fired any shots other than the shot into the exhaust port, a sizeable point bonus is awarded for 'using the force'. If the exhaust port is missed, Red 5 will plough through the wall at the end of the trench and lose one deflector shield, after which the trench run will start over.  
 
If the player succeeds in blowing up the Death Star, Red 5 makes its escape before turning to view the colourful explosion. Bonus points for Remaining Shield Energy is now scored.  
 
The player is then returned to the fray and whole process begins again. Each successive Death Star run greatly increases in difficulty; TIE Fighters shoot more often, there are more Laser towers and batteries in successive rounds and there are many more obstacles and laser fire during the trench run.</desc>

    <name>Sunset Riders</name>
    <desc>Sunset Riders is a horizontally-scrolling platform shoot-em-up for up to four players set in America's Wild West. Four sharpshooter bounty hunters (Steve, Billy, Bob and Cormano) set out to claim the bounties for killing the most wanted outlaws in the West, before a final showdown against the infamous Sir Richard de la Rose. 
 
The action takes place both on foot and on horseback, with play sometimes broken up with a wild west pursuit; such as having to run along the backs of a herd of fleeing Buffalo. Each level ends with players entering a one-on-one battle against one of the wanted men they have been pursuing.  
 
Power-ups and bonus items can be obtained by entering saloons or defeating certain sack-carrying bandits. The power-ups comes in the form of either a golden sheriff badge (that gives the player's weapon auto-fire) or a silver badge that gives the player a second gun (making it possible to shoot in two directions simultaneously). Both power-ups can be equipped at the same time.  
 
Other weapons that can be used by players include sticks of dynamite carried by female bandits that can be thrown back at the enemy before they explode and a mounted Gatling gun available only in the last stage.  
 
A bonus mini-game appears at the end of Stages 2 and 5 in which players must shoot at enemies from a first-person perspective before the timer runs out. 
 
Sunset Riders features eight stages of play.</desc>

    <desc>Super Gem Fighter: Mini Mix / Pocket Fighter is a superb, abstract and humorous fighting game featuring miniaturized renditions from several Capcom fighting games; including the legendary "Street Fighter" series, as well as "Darkstalkers" and the little-known "Red Earth". 
 
During a bout, players will be able to release coloured gems from successful attacks against their opponent, as well as from wooden chests that regularly appear. Collecting these gems will 'power-up' the player's character, giving them more powerful attacks. There are two bars and three sub-bars in the interface. The two main bars are the life bar and the super bar; the first indicates the player's health and the second their ability to throw super combos. The Super Bar itself can be filled up to nine levels, allowing players to execute more super combos. Each super combo has a level assigned to it, and it uses Super Bars depending on it.</desc>

    <name>Super Hang-On</name>
    <desc>Super Hang-On is a checkpoint-based racing game and is the sequel to the acclaimed "Hang-On", released two years earlier. As with the prequel, players take control of a superbike and must race over twisting road-based circuits, avoiding rival bikers and trying to reach the end-of-stage checkpoint before the time limit expires. 
 
For the sequel, Sega introduced the hilly, undulating roads that had been executed so superbly in 1986's "Out Run". The gameplay was further enhanced with the introduction of the 'turbo' button. Upon reaching the bike's maximum speed of 280kph, players could press and hold the turbo and push the bike up to 324kph - something that was necessary to beat the game's extremely tight time limits. This had to be used carefully, however, as the increase in speed made the bike harder to control and accelerating at the wrong time would invariably see a head-on collision with either rival bikers or the road-side objects that litter the stages. 
 
Players could chose to race on any one of four courses: Africa, Asia, America and Europe. Africa is the easiest and shortest of the four, with each subsequent course becoming both more demanding - with tighter bends and more aggressive rival racers - and having a greater number of stages to have to beat. Africa, for example, is made up of only six stages, while the hardest course, Europe, has eighteen stages.</desc>

    <name>Super Pac-Man</name>
    <desc>Super Pac-Man is a 1- or 2-player game where you are in control of the legendary Pac-Man. As in the original "Pac-Man" game, the goal is to clear each maze, but this time, instead of dots, the maze consists of prizes which are locked away behind gates. There are two ways to access the prizes. You can eat the keys which open a particular gate, and not always the gate which is closest to that key. Or you can crash through the gate after you eat a Super Pill and become Super Pac-Man. You are not required to eat all of the keys in order to complete the stage.  
 
Four Power Pills are in maze and allow Pac-Man to turn the tables on the ghosts and eat them for a short time. When the ghosts begin to flash, time is running out and they will switch back, so beware.  
 
New in this game is the Super Pill. There are two Super Pills in the maze which allow Pac-Man to become Super Pac-Man for a limited period of time. While in Super form, Pac-Man can crash through the maze gates, fly over the ghosts and avoid being killed (or eat them when they're blue), and travel at super speed whenever the player presses and holds the Super Speed button. When the super power is about to run out, Pac-Man flashes white and then returns to his normal form. You can extend the duration of Super time by eating a regular Power Pill. The Super time will then be extended by the duration of the ghosts' blue time.  
 
Pac-Man loses one life whenever a ghost catches him when the ghost is not blue and Pac-Man is not in Super form. You start with a set number of lives ('Lives' dip switch), and bonus lives can be awarded to you as you reach or pass certain preselected point values ('Extra Lives' dip switch).  
 
The tunnel is a great way to put some space between you and any ghosts that are on your tail since they can only move half as fast as you when they are in it. In Super Pac-Man, the ghosts are also slowed down by travelling through the passage directly beneath the ghost pen. 
 
Occasionally, a star will appear in the middle of the screen with a picture on the left, and a rotating picture on the right. You may eat the star at any time for bonus points, but if you manage to eat the star when the right picture matches the left one, you will receive a larger bonus.  
 
As the stages increases, the ghosts speed up their pursuit of Pac-Man and they stay blue for shorter and shorter periods of time after he eats a Power Pill until, in the high stages, they do not turn blue at all.  
 
Super Pac-Man also features bonus stages in Stage 3, Stage 7, and every fourth stage thereafter, where there are no ghosts, a time limit, and Pac-Man is in Super form throughout the stage. Your goal is to eat all of the prizes in the given time limit. As with gameplay on the regular levels, you don't need to eat all (or any) of the keys. You are awarded the remaining time in the counter as points for successfully eating everything. With each Bonus stage, the walls and gates change color.

    <name>Super Punch-Out</name>
    <desc>Super Punch-Out!! is an update of the superb boxing game, "Punch-Out!!", featuring five new larger-than-life opponents. The player once again assumes the role of a green-haired boxer who must fight his way up through five boxers to earn the title of 'Champ'.  
 
As with the original game, the player's boxer is viewed from behind with his torso rendered with wire-frame graphics (allowing the player's opponent to be easily seen). Punches, dodges and blocks must all be well-timed in order to defeat the opponent.  
 
Both the player and the opponent have stamina meters displayed at the top of the screen. These decrease when either boxer takes a punch and boxers will get knocked down if their stamina meter runs out completely. Faster knockdowns will cause the fallen boxer to recover less stamina upon getting up; the same happens if a boxer is knocked down by a knockout punch.  
 
Thanks to the refined roster of new and hugely distinctive enemy fighters, Super Punch-Out!! is considered to be an improvement over the first game.</desc>

The game consists of seven levels, mostly based on action scenes from the film, including confrontations over Macross City, in the rings of Saturn, the surface of the devastated Earth, and the final battle against Boddole Zer. 
 
Gameplay is similar to Raiden: the Valkyrie can transform into one of three different modes by collecting the appropriate power-up: in Fighter mode, the ship fires a spread shot, Gerwalk mode has a narrow but powerful laser that passes through enemies, and Battroid mode features homing missiles. The intensity of the attacks can be upgraded in three stages through another power-up. There are also smart bombs to pick up that clear most enemies off the screen with one shot. Each level ends with a boss battle. Besides shooting down the hordes of enemies, picking up medals and rare Minmay dolls also increases the score. In two-player mode, both players take on the enemy simultaneously. Between levels, cutscenes recreate scenes from the film to illustrate the storyline.</desc>

    <desc>Like "Championship Sprint", released the same year, Super Sprint is an updated version of the old Atari Sprint series; with added the ability to allow players to upgrade their vehicles as the game progresses. Upgrades are won by collecting wrenches that appear once per track. After a player has collected four wrenches, they will be presented with an upgrade screen; giving them the opportunity to choose better traction, increased top speed, faster acceleration, or a faster helicopter. The only discernible difference between this and "Championship Sprint" is the addition of brand new tracks.</desc>

It also introduced the hidden character of Akuma, who would go on to become a recurring character in later Street Fighter installments and other Capcom fighting games.</desc>

    <desc>Wild Fang is a sideways scrolling beat-em-up for 1 or 2 players with a medieval setting. Players take on a variety of orcs, ogres, demons and other mythical creatures in their bid to destroy Satan, decapitating each enemy they encounter in order to collect their skulls for points and power-ups. 
 
The player's character is an armor wearing beastmaster who sits atop of a fist-fighting giant.  Upon the player's command, the player may switch his mount into a tiger and attack with his mace.  Within each stage, there are also power-ups that allow the player to morph into a laser breathing dragon for a limited period of time. 
 
The player's life bar is represented by a fire breathing dragon in the upper corner.  With each hit the player takes, the fire breath grows smaller.  Once the life bar is depleted the player's mount is killed and the player travels on foot and fights with throwing daggers.  If hit in this form then the player loses a life.  The game is over when all of a players lives are lost.</desc>

    <desc>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a side-scrolling beat 'em up released by Konami in 1989. It is based on the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles animated series which began airing in the winter of 1987. The player chooses from one of the four Ninja Turtles: Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael. After Shredder kidnaps the Turtles' friend April O'Neil and their mentor Splinter, they must give chase, save their comrades, and defeat the evil Shredder. Up to four players (two in some versions) can take control of any of the Turtles. Donatello has slower attacks but a longer range, Michelangelo and Raphael have faster attacks but a shorter range, and Leonardo is a well-rounded Turtle with average range and speed. Most of the enemies the Turtles face are the Foot Soldiers, all color-coded to indicate their attack patterns and weapon of choices. Some enemies, such as the standard purple-clad Foot Soldiers and Roadkill Rodney robots, have the ability to restrain the Turtles' mobility and drain their health, leaving the player open to attack for other enemies. The bosses in the game include Rocksteady and Bebop (individually at first in that order, and later the two of them together), Baxter Stockman, Granitor, General Traag, Krang, and Shredder himself.</desc>

Yet again, Konami's mastery of the genre was in evidence as the manic energy and humour of the cartoon and comic-book series upon which the game is based was captured perfectly.</desc>

Like Capcom's Knights of the Round, it features a level advancement system, allowing character attributes to be upgraded as players progress through the game. The setting is very similar to that of Dungeons &amp; Dragons and other medieval fantasy worlds, with familiar monsters such as Orcs, Gnolls, Harpies, Wyverns, Cyclopes, and Minotaurs.

The game was ported to the Super NES and released in 1994. An emulated version of the game was released as part of Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 2 and Capcom Classics Collection: Reloaded.</desc>

    <name>The Outfoxies</name>
    <desc>A platform 'versus' shoot'em up in which either one player (playing against the computer) or two players (playing against each other) attempt to destroy each other by any means necessary. The levels themselves are interesting and varied, with airships, planes etc. providing a detailed and highly interactive backdrop in which the players do battle. That interactivity is increased further with the introduction of destructible sections which, when blown up, can often open up new areas or rooms. Each level is littered with a variety of weapons that can be picked up and utilized by the player(s). Graphically, Outfoxies employed superb sprite scale and rotation techniques that elevated the already fun gameplay still further. The aeroplane level, for instance, dips and sways, bringing problems of inertia and gravity to the platform action. Also; the in-game camera zooms in and out of the level, depending on how far away the two opponents are from each other. Playable characters range from a monkey to a pair of psychotic school children, with each character choice offering the player different aptitudes (the monkey can jump higher, for example). A fun enough game in one-player mode, Outfoxies really came into its own when two human protagonists took part.</desc>

    <desc>A jewel heist gone wrong sees Mr Burns's sidekick, Smithers, kidnapping Maggie and making his escape. Between one and four players take on the role of either Homer, Marge, Lisa, or Bart in this colorful, horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up from Konami. Each Simpsons character possesses an attacking move specific to them; Marge is armed with a vacuum cleaner, Lisa has a skipping rope, Bart has his skateboard, and Homer fights with his fists. The players must battle their way through a variety of Simpsons-themed levels - such as Springfield and Krustyland - fighting goons, thugs, zombies, drunks, firemen, and several Simpsons regulars. Many Simpsons characters that don't appear as enemies have 'cameo' scenes in the game (Otto working at a burgerstand in Krustyland, for example). The archetypal 'boss' character awaits the players at the end of every stage. The game ends with a final showdown with the evil Mr. Burns in his luxurious mansion. 
 
The Simpsons was designed to Konami's typically-high production standards and was, like the 'Ninja Turtles' games that appeared a couple of years' earlier, very faithful to its source material. The colorful, smoothly-animated sprites captured the spirit of the legendary cartoon superbly, and the game's many humorous touches were timed to perfection.</desc>

Thunder Blade consists of four stages, which are as follows: 
Stage 1: The game begins in a skyscraper-packed city. Enemies consist of rival choppers, jets, and ground-based tanks and gun emplacements. The level ends over the sea, with the player facing a huge and heavily-armed battleship.  
Stage 2: This stage begins with the player navigating a desert canyon, before switching to the into-the-screen view and taking the player through a number of stalactite-packed and densely populated caves. A huge ground-based tank awaits the player at the end of the stage. 
Stage 3: This begins in a river canyon, before moving on to a rain-forest river network. As well the the usual line-up of enemies, heavily-armed boats are introduced. the end-of-level battle takes place in the skies as the player attempts to destroy a massive jet fighter. 
Stage 4: The 4th and final stage begins with a repeat of the first stage's city level, only this time the action takes place at night. The second half of this stage takes the player deep into an industrial complex, eventually leading to an end-of-game showdown with a massive and heavily-armed gun emplacement.</desc>

It features elements of tongue-in-cheek humor combined with the action. The player takes control of an enchanted ape who must battle hordes of jungle monsters with energy balls from his mouth (described humorously as "monkey-spit" or "monkey-vomit" by some gamers). The ultimate goal is to destroy the evil wizard who cast a spell on you; therefore transforming yourself from an ape back into a human, and rescuing the kidnapped princess. The game was ported to several video game consoles and home computers.</desc>

    <desc>Track &amp; Field © 1983 Konami.

Track &amp; Field is an athletics-themed action game for up to four players, who compete against each other in six track and field-based disciplines. 

The game controls consist of two run buttons (one for each 'leg' of the athlete) and one 'Action' button. Players must hit the two run buttons alternately to build up speed and use action button to jump or throw.

In each event, there is a qualifying time or minimum score threshold that the player must achieve to advance to the next event. failing to qualify (in one heat for track events or in three attempts in the other events) will reduce the players' number of lives by one, the game is over once all lives are lost.

Track &amp; Field can accommodate up to four players, who compete in pairs in the running events and individually in the others. If there are fewer than four players, the remaining slots are played by the computer (or player "CPU"). In all multiplayer heats, however, the relative performance of the players has no effect on the game and advancing is based solely on reaching qualifying times and targets.

The six events are:

100M DASH - Run as fast as possible.
LONG JUMP - Run to the take-off board then choose angle of jump (42 is the optimum angle).
JAVELIN - Run to the line then choose angle of throw (43 is the optimum angle).
110M HURDLES - Run and time jumps over the hurdles.
HAMMER THROW - As the athlete spins faster and faster, time release of hammer and angle of throw (45 is the optimum angle).
HIGH JUMP - The athlete will run to the bar; just as he reaches it, use Action button to start the jump and hold down the action button to reduce the angle of climb, i.e. you start going straight up at 90 degrees if you tap the button just once. Use run buttons while in the air to gain extra height.</desc>

    <name>Tron</name>
    <desc>Tron is a 1- or 2-player game set inside the 'Tron' computer, and is based on the ground-breaking Disney movie of the same name. 
 
Tron consists of twenty-two stages - or 'phases' - of play. Each phase consists of four separate games called "domains", all of which must be completed before moving on to the next phase. Players can determine the order in which each of the four domains is attempted, but the domain position is random and is only revealed once that domain has been chosen. 
 
The four domains that make up a phase never change throughout the game, although both the difficulty level and number of enemies increases with each subsequent phase. The domains are as follows: 
 
LIGHT CYCLES: The player controls a Light Cycle that leaves a blue light trail in its wake. The aim is to 'box in' the yellow enemy Light Cycles, making them crash into either a cycle trail (theirs or the player's) or a wall. The player must also avoid any collision with either walls or light trails. The joystick controls the direction of the bike and the trigger controls its speed. 
I/O TOWER: Destroy the Grid Bugs that emerge from the grid surrounding the tower. The bugs will multiply and fill the entire screen if not stopped. Players must attempt to clear a path to - and enter - the I/O Tower before the timer runs out. The stick controls the movement of the player's character and the spinner controls the direction of fire. 
TANK MAZE: Destroy all enemy tanks that are patrolling the maze. The player's tank can fire in all directions and can bounce shots off walls, but can be destroyed by a single shot; while enemy tanks can only fire in the direction of travel but need three shots before they are destroyed. "Recognizer" tanks also feature in later phases; these Do NOT shoot but move quickly and will try to ram the player's tank. The joystick controls the movement of the player's tank and the spinner controls the direction of fire. 
MCP CONE: Destroy the blocks in the descending, rotating coloured column to clear a path and move the character up into the light cone above the blocks. A bonus is awarded if all of the blocks are destroyed. The stick controls the movement of the character and the spinner controls the direction of fire. 
 
Bonus lives are awarded periodically throughout the game as specific point scores are reached. Each enemy and item has an assigned point value (see the "SCORING" section for details).</desc>

There are power-ups to increase ship speed, add a smartbomb to your stock, and change/strengthen your current weapon. Red fires bombs in a small area around your ship,  blue is a homing laser, and green fires wide-reaching salvos of green shots.</desc>

Holding down the fire button sucks the enemies into the cleaner, releasing the button causes them to be expelled back out. Ejected enemies act as projectiles that can damage and kill any other on-screen enemies that they collide with. All enemies must be killed before players can progress to the next stage.  
 
Throughout the game, letters of the alphabet randomly appear in bubbles. These can be collected to eventually spell the word "TUMBLEPOP". Once this has been achieved players are transported to a time-limited bonus level, giving them the opportunity to earn bonus points and extra lives.

In single-player mode, one person controls both characters on a team. In two-player mode, the players either cooperate by playing on the same team or compete against each other by controlling opposing teams. The American version allows the game to be played by up to four players (if the cabinet allows it). The single-player mode consists of two cycles with four stages: the Minor Circuit and the Major Circuit. The stages in the game are Daytona Beach, New York, Los Angeles and Hawaii. After completing the Major Circuit, the player faces against the U.S. Navy team, set in a naval base. 
 
The controls consist of an eight directional joystick and two buttons for jumping and receiving. The characters perform several moves including power spiking, back spiking, jump-serving, blocking and diving. 
 
There are a few minor differences between the Japanese and American releases. The Japanese release features an opening cut-scene explaining the plot. Between matches, intermission sequences depict the main characters visiting a car dealership to purchase a vehicle. As the player progresses, the cars increase in quality, shifting from used cars to new cars during the Major Circuit. The American release removes these cut-scenes, but extends the multiplayer support to up to four players with multiple game modes: 1 or 2 players against the computer, 1-on-1, 2-on-1, or 2-on-2.</desc>

They must fight every lackey and vanquish Dr. Clayborn in order to restore law and order to the city.  
 
Besides the usual human thugs, players fight strange mole creatures and mutants with jet packs and blades for hands. Players can never use enemy weapons, but the stages contain objects that can be picked up and used instead, These include burning oil drums, steel girders, concrete columns that shatter on impact, boxes of hand grenades and giant fish.  
 
As well as the standard punch and kick moves, each character also has a special attack. This move is more powerful than standard attacks but each time a special attack is executed, some of the player's health is lost. 
 
Player characters can eat mice, frogs, birds and snails to restore their health. The game consists of five stages with a powerful enemy boss character waiting at the end of each one.</desc>

    <name>Vigilante</name>
    <desc>A sequel to Irem's legendary 1984 beat-em-up, "Kung-Fu Master", Vigilante sees the hero's girlfriend, Madonna, kidnapped by a gang of thugs and driven away in the back of their van. The vigilante must fight through five enemy-packed levels to rescue his girlfriend. As with "Kung-Fu Master", a tough guardian enemy awaits the player at the end of each level. The guardians must be defeated as quickly as possible as their energy bars will replenish in between the player's attacks. 
 
A weapon, in the form of Nunchakas, can occasionally be found and picked-up; adding to the player's 'kick' and 'punch' fighting moves. Some of the game's many enemies are also armed, with either clubs, chains, knives or guns. The game ends once Madonna is rescued.</desc>

    <name>Violent Storm</name>
    <desc>Violent Storm is a sideways-scrolling beat-em-up for up to three players set in the aftermath of World War III. The survivors of the war are attempting to rebuild their world but are being terrorised by violent gangs . Three vigilante heroes called 'Boris', 'Wade' and 'Kyle' are trying to protect the citizens but are hampered in their efforts by the evil and corrupt 'GELD' gang. As the heroes are patrolling the streets, they see their friend, Sheena, kidnapped by the gang. The vigilantes must fight through seven enemy-packed stages to rescue their friend and destroy the gang. 
 
As well as the standard punch and kick moves, each character also has a special attack. This move is powerful enough to fell several enemies at once, but with the trade-off that each time a special attack is executed, some of the player's health is lost. Health levels can be replenished by finding the food that lies hidden in breakable crates and barrels.  
 
Some of the gang members will drop a weapon when they are felled. These weapons can then be picked up and used by the players. Destructible crates and barrels also contain weapons and random bonus items. Stunned enemies fall to the ground and can still be attacked while prone.</desc>

The game consists of 6 levels, each representing a scene from the movie. Defeated enemies drop gold coins that can be collected by the player.

The gold can be used to purchase a number of weapons and character power-ups from a nearby shop (represented on screen by a wise old man). All power-ups will stay with the player until all lives are lost and the game is over.</desc>

Each single-screen dungeon consists of a grid forming walls and corridors. There are doors situated at the left and right edges of the screen that are inter-connected, making the dungeon wrap around. Whenever a door is used by a player or monster, it deactivates for a short period, making it impassable. A small radar display indicates the positions of all active monsters.

At the start of the game Wonder Boy is unarmed, but the mayor of Wonder Land (as it was known before the invasion) gives him a short sword to help him in his quest. Wonder Boy has a life meter represented as a series of red hearts and whenever he sustains damage, the hearts deplete. When all the hearts are depleted, Wonder Boy dies and the game ends. As well as the life meter, there is also an Hourglass Timer at the top of the screen; whenever this runs out, Wonder Boy loses some life. The Timer can be refilled by collecting hourglasses or by visiting hospitals or taverns.</desc>

The game itself is a side-scroller like R-Type, albeit with a short vertical-scrolling area towards the end of the sixth level. Instead of the Force pod, however, the main power-up apparatus takes the form of two flexible tentacles. The tentacles are invulnerable to all enemy attacks, and can be positioned with careful maneuvering of the X-002.</desc>

Now the Xevions want Earth back -- minus humans! Their invasion forces are fierce -- the land is crawling with deadly Domogram Rovers; the sky is black with Toroid Patrol Fleets and Zoshi Death Squads.

Our puny weapons offer no defense. Earth's only hope is our powerful new Solvalou Fighter Plane. Its pilot will have a single mission: Penetrate the enemy ranks and destroy the Xevious Mother Ship.

The mission is dangerous. We can't guarantee success. But at this point, it's do or die!

One small problem. We still need a pilot. Any volunteers?</desc>

    <desc>Xexex is a horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up in which players pilot a ship called the 'Flintlock' and must save the blue-haired Princess Irene of the planet E-Square from an evil lord named Klaus.  
 
The player's ship has a detachable orb attachment called the Flint, which behaves in a similar fashion to the 'Force Device' from Irem's "R-Type" series. Power-ups can be obtained to increase the Flint's power, movement speed, change the main weapon, or even give the player an extra life. 
 
The player starts the game armed with the Proton Laser, which emits thin stream of weak bullets. Defeating certain enemies will drop other weapons: 
Homing Laser: A 3-way laser with weak "bending" homing for top and bottom lasers. 
Shadow Laser: A laser beam that creates a damage-inflicting shadow as the ship moves up and down.  
Round Laser: An unusual spread shot (different from the overseas version's main weapon) 
Spiral Laser: A spiral laser of considerable width. 
Search Laser: A laser with strong homing that travels in square trajectories. 
Ground Laser: Fires an upgraded Proton Laser along with a laser beam that travels along the ground. 
 
The name of the current weapon is displayed at the bottom of the screen. In the non-Japanese overseas versions, the only available weapon is the Proton Laser and picking up power-ups simply increases the spread of the weapon. Missiles are a secondary weapon.</desc>

Each X-Man character has an 'Attack', 'Jump' and 'Mutant Power' button. The mutant power attack is a powerful special move unique to each X-Man. While it inflicts a lot of damage on the enemies, the trade-off is that each usage removes 3 bars from the players health meter (a full meter has 10 bars). Each level ends with a face-off against a powerful mutant boss character. 
 
The game has six stages, with the final one set on 'Asteroid M', Magneto's base. The defeated mutant bosses from the previous levels each make an appearance (albeit in a less powerful form) before the final encounter with Magneto himself. 
 
Players can chose from 6 X-Men characters, they are: 
Cyclops  
Colossus  
Wolverine  
Storm  
Nightcrawler  
Dazzler</desc>

It enjoyed a degree of success in arcades and was subsequently ported to the Mega Drive by Toaplan on May 31, 1991, in Japan, and by Sega during the following year in Europe, followed by a Japan-only release by Naxat Soft on September 18, 1992, for the PC Engine's CD-ROM². 
 
The European version of the Mega Drive port was the source for "All your base are belong to us", an Internet meme which plays off the poorly translated English in the game's introduction. 
 
Set in 2101, the game follows the signing of a peace treaty between the United Nations and CATS, an alien cyborg. However, CATS breaks the covenant and takes control of the Japanese space colonies. The protagonist leads the ZIG spacecraft, managed to escape from the mother ship destroyed by CATS, with the aim to defeat enemy forces and liberate the Earth. 
 
As with other scrolling shooters, the aim of the game is to shoot all enemies that appear on screen and avoid getting obliterated by enemy fire, crashing into enemies or into foreground scenery. There are mid-level and end-of-level boss enemies that stay with the player until they are defeated. The game features eight levels.</desc>
